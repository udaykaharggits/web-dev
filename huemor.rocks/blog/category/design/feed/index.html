<p>Cause-based websites exist to secure the reader’s attention and invite them to support their cause. This website<a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/about-us-page-design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> conveys what it’s about</a> in a unique and enjoyable way with a compelling story and the site immerses users.

<p>This is a top example of how e-commerce has evolved throughout the years. Websites have taken a bold leap from sleek and concise platforms to detailed and interactive landing pages. This type of design is becoming the norm for a good reason. The pop of color on the website is vibrant but easy on the eyes, effectively highlighting each product. The animations for the drinks gives them a creative blend of having a look that&#8217;s both creative and realistic at the same time, practically inviting the audience to reach over and grab the drinks themselves.</p>

<p>The website is an ideal match for their brand with a cohesive theme. The layout is consistent throughout all the pages, giving a very neat and minimal vibe. The<a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/top-homepage-design-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> homepage</a> is the first thing users see in a website, so putting their new products there directly is a good move as well since it encourages viewers to purchase their products. Although the site seems simple at first glance, the technology page adds an interactive touch and the eye-catching animations make the page more interesting and appealing.</p>

<p>Blending shapes together to create images seems to be an emerging trend among websites lately. It can only be seen once on this website but it is used effectively nonetheless. The way new information pops out as you scroll through the homepage is satisfying, despite being a simple feature. The hamburger navigation is useful and clean; you can easily find what you need and does encourage visitors to visit each landing page.</p>



<h2>6. <a href="https://elementaryml.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><a href="https://elementaryml.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Elementary</strong></a></h2>

<p>Many websites opt to use loud colors to match their brand, but the muted aesthetic of this website design complements its products perfectly. The color scheme is strategically planned out, making the website look clean and classy.&nbsp; It integrates a splash of color in some areas as needed, but the solid colors and simple backgrounds divert the audience’s attention towards the products. The advanced imagery for their technology is a strong element as well, as it showcases how their products are used directly on the homepage making them an excellent example of an engaging experience.</p>



<h2>7. <a href="https://beauvoir.ca/en/services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><a href="https://beauvoir.ca/en/services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Beauvoir</strong></a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="660" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Beauvoir@2x-1024x660.jpg" alt="Beauvoir@2x" class="wp-image-30834" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Beauvoir@2x-1024x660.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Beauvoir@2x-300x193.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Beauvoir@2x-768x495.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Beauvoir@2x-1536x990.jpg 1536w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Beauvoir@2x-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Beauvoir@2x-36x23.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Beauvoir@2x-48x31.jpg 48w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Beauvoir@2x.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The website’s overall design feels very bold and modern. Viewers are greeted with an informative video on the homepage, which highlights the strengths of their company to their potential customers and users. By sharing information in a video format, it invites visitors to dive deeper into the site&#8217;s design and in turn are more likely to end up on one of the site&#8217;s landing page. The content has a pattern of moving from up and down, left to right, before going up and down again as you scroll. There is a lot of movement on the page but it’s incorporated so well that it doesn’t look messy or cluttered at all. Overall, the animations and the overall graphic design of the website give it a unique and creative vibe.</p>



<h2>8. <a href="https://www.coffeeaddress.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><a href="https://www.coffeeaddress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Coffee Address</strong></a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="660" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Coffee-Address@2x-1024x660.jpg" alt="Coffee Address@2x" class="wp-image-30835" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Coffee-Address@2x-1024x660.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Coffee-Address@2x-300x193.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Coffee-Address@2x-768x495.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Coffee-Address@2x-1536x990.jpg 1536w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Coffee-Address@2x-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Coffee-Address@2x-36x23.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Coffee-Address@2x-48x31.jpg 48w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Coffee-Address@2x.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>It seems that the company is going for a clean and simple branding, and the website does a good job of staying true to its designated aesthetic. The entire page feels light, soft, and airy. It’s equipped with nice animations and imagery paired with decorative elements. There isn’t much going on but the deliberate and captivating combination of each element is what makes the website so enjoyable to scroll through. The simple and clean design of Coffee Address&#8217; use of white space between the graphic design images makes this website design inspiration and goals for small businesses!</p>



<h2>9. <a href="https://www.drinkminna.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><a href="https://www.drinkminna.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Minna</strong></a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="660" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Minna@2x-1024x660.jpg" alt="Minna@2x" class="wp-image-30836" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Minna@2x-1024x660.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Minna@2x-300x193.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Minna@2x-768x495.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Minna@2x-1536x990.jpg 1536w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Minna@2x-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Minna@2x-36x23.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Minna@2x-48x31.jpg 48w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Minna@2x.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<p>The site&#8217;s design for this website is very polished and neat, which can be seen in the fonts and subtle animations. The color palette comes off quite sleek at first since it’s primarily composed of black and white, but a nice splash of vibrance comes in once orange is added. The contrast of the bold-colored text on a dark background really makes it stand out. If we had to describe the entire with using one word, it would definitely be ‘luxurious.’</p>

<p>Yet another luxurious website on our list. From the color palette to the subtle animations, all elements of the site work well together and effectively highlight the products. The round sections and the animations complement each other smoothly as viewers scrolls through the page. The footer also looks premium, incorporating a chic font with a plain background. The product itself is simplistic, but it is presented in a way that makes it look very experimental and interesting. This website incorporates several unique usability elements which makes them a website design inspiration and a best website on our list.</p>

<p>This is what a high-end E-Commerce experience looks like and a website design inspiration. The website matches the brand’s theme by making something as subtle as paint seem interesting. This can be seen in the swatches on the homepage, which look similar to a watercolor or eyeshadow palette. Customers will receive mix &amp; match recommendations based on their selected color. The website is very pleasing to look at because of its incredible imagery and ideal use of typography. Its design is easy to navigate and provides a high-quality shopping experience for all users.</p>

<p>The website is very engaging and interactive, which encourages viewers to explore their page. The scroll is continuous and filled with dynamic animations. The use of parallax and typography is well thought out, growing bigger and bolder to suit the content of their respective sections. The micro-interaction holds the reader’s attention from the opening of the website up to the end, allowing them to keep scrolling and learning more about the company without getting bored.</p>

<p>The website’s theme suits the brand well. The organic color scheme of the site matches their products, creating a minimal vibe that complement’s their brand’s personality. The elements are incorporated nicely. The homepage contains a lot of information and maximizes the space but the way it is designed doesn’t make the page look messy or cluttered at all. The loading animation when switching to another page is a nice touch as well. It adds a nifty transition while users navigate their website.</p>

<p>The website offers a refreshing take on a monochrome color scheme. The entire website only uses black and white for its text, images, and elements but the way it is all integrated into the design does not look boring or dull at all. The animations are the highlight of its overall design. There is a drawn figure at the top of the website that leads the user as they scroll through the page, continuously transforming into different shapes and images with each section. This subtle animation enhances interactivity and makes the website fun to navigate despite the lack of color.</p>

<p>The design of the website is a great match for their brand, specifically their products.

<p>The website displays a good use of space and font. Images and product offerings take up the majority of the page, complemented by large graphic text. Everything is detailed by neutral tones and outlines, which adds a simple but eye-catching touch to its design. The only downside would be how the drag cursor appears with the size selectors. Aside from that, the website stands as a solid example.</p>

<p>Horizontal Scroll has been on the rise recently. This is our first time seeing a website use horizontal scroll throughout all of its pages. It was a bold move but it turned out well. It was executed beautifully across the website, filled with subtle moving animations. We enjoyed this website so much that it actually inspired us to create our own take on it! We have decided to use this as our main inspiration for our HITT project this year.</p>

<p>From the moment you open the website, you’ll see that its structure bears resemblance to the way Apple introduces its new products. This style is becoming increasingly popular among different brands and companies. It’s good that this website executed the trend in a way that makes it its own. The animations make it feel like you’re watching a video rather than scrolling through a page. Each scroll up and down feels like you’re hitting rewind or fast forward.

<p>They&#8217;re what translates your hard work generating traffic into business opportunities.</p>

<span id="more-30669"></span>



<p>Many marketers for B2B businesses often overlook the importance of both the contents and style of their contact forms.</p>



<p>They assume that if someone is interested enough in the offer they&#8217;ll fill out anything. That is simply not true.</p>



<p>Just think about it — how many times have you abandoned a bad contact form experience? Most likely too many to count.</p>



<p>Contact forms that&#8230;</p>



<ul><li>Ask too many questions</li><li>Don&#8217;t make it obvious what&#8217;s required</li><li>Don&#8217;t make it obvious when you&#8217;ve completed something</li></ul>



<p>These poor decisions with contact forms hurt your business more than you&#8217;re probably even aware of.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re a marketer tasked with improving lead quality or volume for your business, improving your contact forms should be your first main objective.</p>



<p><meta charset="utf-8">Even small changes can have a huge impact on both the volume of inquiries you’ll receive and the quality of those opportunities.</p>



<p>In this article, we’ll be sharing research-backed conversion tips on how to improve your contact forms. We&#8217;ll also discuss more advanced ideas that B2B businesses can take advantage of to reduce the need for certain fields while still getting all the information you need from a prospect.</p>



<p>Ready to take your contact forms to the next level? Let&#8217;s dive in.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>10 UX Best Practices for Forms</strong></h2>



<p>Before we dive into the more advanced conversion tips, let’s cover some general contact form best practices from a user experience perspective. These tips are easy to understand and implement and are an effective way to<a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/how-to-improve-your-website" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> improve your website without a full redesign</a>.</p>



<h3><strong>Keep Your Forms Short</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="633" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Keep-Your-Forms-Short@2x-1024x633.jpg" alt="Keep Your Forms Short@2x" class="wp-image-30699" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Keep-Your-Forms-Short@2x-1024x633.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Keep-Your-Forms-Short@2x-300x185.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Keep-Your-Forms-Short@2x-768x475.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Keep-Your-Forms-Short@2x-1536x950.jpg 1536w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Keep-Your-Forms-Short@2x-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Keep-Your-Forms-Short@2x-36x22.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Keep-Your-Forms-Short@2x-48x30.jpg 48w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Keep-Your-Forms-Short@2x.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Attention spans around the world are<a href="https://psychminds.com/is-the-internet-destroying-our-attentions-span/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> decreasing with every passing year</a>, so the pressure is on your contact form to keep them engaged. The most straightforward way to accomplish this is to keep your form structure short.</p>



<p>By limiting the number of fields the user has to fill out upfront, the likelihood of form completion goes up by as much as 50%, as verified by a study from<a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/6746/Which-Types-of-Form-Fields-Lower-Landing-Page-Conversions.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Hubspot</a> that tested the effect of reducing the number of fields from 4 to 3. In addition,<a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/contact-form-conversion-rate/?display=wide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Quickspot</a> found that the conversion rate with only 3 fields was 25%, compared to 20% for 3-5 fields and 16% for 6+ fields. Keep in mind, however, that indiscriminately deleting fields might<a href="https://www.ventureharbour.com/how-form-length-impacts-conversion-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> hurt your conversion rate</a> instead — you need to know what fields your users want to fill out.</p>



<h3><strong>Make Sure Fields Are Consistently Sized</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="633" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Make-Sure-Fields-Are-Consistently-Sized@2x-1024x633.jpg" alt="Make Sure Fields Are Consistently Sized@2x" class="wp-image-30702" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Make-Sure-Fields-Are-Consistently-Sized@2x-1024x633.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Make-Sure-Fields-Are-Consistently-Sized@2x-300x185.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Make-Sure-Fields-Are-Consistently-Sized@2x-768x475.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Make-Sure-Fields-Are-Consistently-Sized@2x-1536x950.jpg 1536w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Make-Sure-Fields-Are-Consistently-Sized@2x-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Make-Sure-Fields-Are-Consistently-Sized@2x-36x22.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Make-Sure-Fields-Are-Consistently-Sized@2x-48x30.jpg 48w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Make-Sure-Fields-Are-Consistently-Sized@2x.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Our eyes follow the motion of our reading, so if your fields are inconsistently sized or unnecessarily long, it makes the experience of filling out your form less user-friendly. </p>



<p>Making sure your form fields are presented with a consistent size is part of form best practices. This improves the rhythm in which the user can easily read, understand, and progress through your forms.</p>



<p>Your site visitors and potential customers are not super likely to complete any long forms and will decrease your average conversion rate. Having optional fields can help lessen the intensity of a form&#8217;s appearance.</p>



<h3><strong>Users Can Tab Through Fields</strong></h3>



<p>Being able to easily tab through contact form fields in their intended order is incredibly helpful for your desktop users. This improves the speed at which they can complete your form. </p>



<p>This way potential customers and qualified leads can lead the conversation to only what fits for them and they want to get out of filling out your form. This can make things quicker for users do not have to fill out unnecessary form fields and shorten the overall form.</p>



<h3><strong>Keep Labels Visible</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="633" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Use-Placeholder-Text-Effectively-1.png" alt="Use Placeholder Text Effectively 1" class="wp-image-30684" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Use-Placeholder-Text-Effectively-1.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Use-Placeholder-Text-Effectively-1-300x185.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Use-Placeholder-Text-Effectively-1-768x475.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Use-Placeholder-Text-Effectively-1-24x15.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Use-Placeholder-Text-Effectively-1-36x22.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Use-Placeholder-Text-Effectively-1-48x30.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>If you’re trying to project a sleek, minimalist image on your business website, you may be tempted to remove labels in favor of just keeping placeholder text for form fields. Don’t do this — it hurts the user experience when they forget what field they’re filling out. It adds friction to the process when they have to erase their answers to verify they’re filling out the right field. </p>



<p>According to this<a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2557265" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> study from Google</a>, the most usable web forms have field labels above the corresponding input fields for quick reference.</p>



<h3><strong>Use Placeholder Text Effectively</strong></h3>



<p>Instead of using the placeholder text to repeat the label name, you should instead use it to present ideal formatting clues. This will ensure that the data entered in the fields better matches your ideal, making it easier for you to sort the information you’ve gathered. </p>



<p>This is especially relevant for fields that deal with information that can be formatted in many different ways, such as dates. Do you want them to enter January 3, 2022, 01/03/22, 03/01/2022, or 01-03-2022? Alternatively, you can also utilize dropdown menus to lessen confusion over formatting.</p>



<h3><strong>Have Clear Active States</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="633" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Clear-Active-State@2x-1024x633.jpg" alt="Clear Active State@2x" class="wp-image-30733" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Clear-Active-State@2x-1024x633.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Clear-Active-State@2x-300x185.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Clear-Active-State@2x-768x475.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Clear-Active-State@2x-1536x950.jpg 1536w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Clear-Active-State@2x-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Clear-Active-State@2x-36x22.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Clear-Active-State@2x-48x30.jpg 48w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Clear-Active-State@2x.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>When your user is actively editing a form field, make sure there are clear visual cues for them to know what they’re editing. You can accomplish this by highlighting the current field in a different color, making the lines more prominent, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Have Clear Error States</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="633" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Have-Clear-Error-States.png" alt="Have Clear Error States" class="wp-image-30680" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Have-Clear-Error-States.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Have-Clear-Error-States-300x185.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Have-Clear-Error-States-768x475.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Have-Clear-Error-States-24x15.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Have-Clear-Error-States-36x22.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Have-Clear-Error-States-48x30.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>If your user makes a mistake while filling out the form, make sure they know right away and it’s<a href="https://www.zuko.io/blog/a-guide-to-error-messages-in-online-forms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> clear what the error is</a>. </p>



<p>For example, if you are asking for their email address and they messed up the domain name, your error message can say “Please use standard domain format, e.g. johndoe@example.com” rather than “Invalid email address.” </p>



<p>Users tend to get frustrated from unclear error messages so by creating a clear and direct error message this will lessen the headache for you and your customers.</p>



<h3><strong>The Button Must Stand Out</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="633" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-Button-Must-Stand-Out.png" alt="The Button Must Stand Out" class="wp-image-30681" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-Button-Must-Stand-Out.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-Button-Must-Stand-Out-300x185.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-Button-Must-Stand-Out-768x475.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-Button-Must-Stand-Out-24x15.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-Button-Must-Stand-Out-36x22.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-Button-Must-Stand-Out-48x30.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>If the dominant color on your webpage is green, what should the color of your “submit” button be? If you think it should be green to match the rest of the page, then stop right there. </p>



<p>The best color for a call to action button, as reviewed by<a href="https://optinmonster.com/which-color-button-converts-best/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> OptinMonster</a>, is one that stands out from the rest of the page. In our previous example, the best color would be red, as it’s the complementary color on the opposite side of the color wheel. This helps draw attention and make the button obvious and visible to your users. </p>



<p>You should also ensure that the button has clear states for hover and click for even more visibility.</p>



<p>An additional tip for increasing the effectiveness of your call to action button is adding a<a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/how-to-use-testimonials/s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> testimonial</a> within the page. A good testimonial might just be the final push for someone to make that click as social proof can boost the number of sign ups your form gets (and your sales team will thank you later!)</p>



<h3><strong>Optimize Your Fields for Mobile</strong></h3>



<p>In 2020,<a href="https://www.perficient.com/insights/research-hub/mobile-vs-desktop-usage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> 68% of global website visits came from mobile</a> instead of desktop. This means that when you want to make a<a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/top-b2b-website-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> truly great B2B website</a>, you need to make sure it looks good on a mobile device. </p>



<p>Make sure your contact forms are optimized and you’re taking advantage of the right mobile keyboard functions per field and a user can easily cycle through the fields on their device. Since to make your short form mobile friendly you have to find of how mobile responsive your form is, due to this you might need to create a mobile version of your form that allows mobile users the ease of use when they are answering your form. </p>



<p>This may end up differing from the desktop version of your web form.</p>



<h3><strong>Make Sure There’s a Clear Confirmation</strong></h3>



<p>It’s frustrating when you click submit on a contact form and the website doesn’t tell you whether or not it worked. Should you wait and see if it gives you any confirmation? Should you fill it in again?</p>



<p>When your user completes the form, it should be obvious to them. An entirely separate “thank you” page is the most preferable option as well as one of the form design best practices for form completion.</p>



<h2><strong>What Form Fields You Actually Need</strong></h2>



<p>Now that we’re done with the general conversion tips, you might be thinking “Everyone says ‘make your form shorter,’ but what fields do I actually need to keep?” Let’s start with what people don’t like filling out:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="633" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/What-Form-Fields-You-Actually-Need@2x-1024x633.jpg" alt="What Form Fields You Actually Need@2x" class="wp-image-30704" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/What-Form-Fields-You-Actually-Need@2x-1024x633.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/What-Form-Fields-You-Actually-Need@2x-300x185.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/What-Form-Fields-You-Actually-Need@2x-768x475.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/What-Form-Fields-You-Actually-Need@2x-1536x950.jpg 1536w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/What-Form-Fields-You-Actually-Need@2x-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/What-Form-Fields-You-Actually-Need@2x-36x22.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/What-Form-Fields-You-Actually-Need@2x-48x30.jpg 48w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/What-Form-Fields-You-Actually-Need@2x.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In the era of data privacy concerns, people are more and more hesitant to give out information like phone numbers and address information. Even if you leave a note that says “We value your privacy. Your information is safe and will never be shared,” the person filling out your form has to take that promise at face value because you haven’t earned their trust yet. </p>



<p>If your contact form is currently asking for personal data, you’re likely putting yourself at a disadvantage. Asking for this information runs the risk of scaring off your users but it remains a<a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/biggest-website-redesign-mistakes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> common website mistake</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In reality, most B2B contact forms only need the following information:</p>



<ul><li>Name</li><li>Email Address</li></ul>



<p>Seriously, that’s it.</p>



<p>If that doesn’t feel like enough information, let’s talk about how you can gain more while still keeping your form as short as possible.</p>



<h2><strong>How To Improve Lead Quality</strong></h2>



<p>So, you now have a name and an email address. That’s plenty of information to start with — provided you use the correct tools.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Use Email Automation To Further Qualify</strong></h3>



<p>Getting people to fill in your contact form is the initial goal, but your overall goal is to nurture your leads and eventually convince them to buy your product or service. The first step to getting more information out of an email address is setting up email automation. </p>



<p>By using email automation to follow up on form submissions, you immediately accomplish two things: you ensure that the email address they submitted is valid and you begin the sales process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A crucial component to the latter objective is sending a personalized email instead of a dry general email. This immediately starts building trust and start to increase conversions. You can even use it to ask 3-5 additional questions you may need to know to qualify the prospect. </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s an example of an e-mail we automatically send after someone fills out a form:</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<div class="wp-container-62474263df358 wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<div class="wp-container-62474263dedd7 wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<p><em>Hi First_Name,</em></p>



<p><em>To make sure we understand what you&#8217;re looking for, please share some information about your project:</em></p>



<ul><li><em>Are you looking for a single project or ongoing work? Or both?</em></li><li><em>What are the biggest challenges/obstacles with your current website?</em></li><li><em>What&#8217;s the project timeline/level of urgency?</em></li><li><em>How much are you looking to invest in this project/engagement?</em></li></ul>



<p>I<em>f you’ve already prepared some useful information, such as an RFP or scope of work, please feel free to attach it to your reply, we’d love to see it.</em></p>



<p><em>Looking forward to your response!</em></p>



<p><em>Cheers!</em></p>



<p><em>Jack Morrin</em></p>



<p><em>Sales Assistant</em></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>This simple touchpoint allows us to quickly create an additional touchpoint with the prospect and ask a few additional qualifying questions that are super important for our sales team. </p>

Would you answer those if it was part of the initial form? Probably not. Keep the initial experience concise and engage more after the form has been submitted.</p><div class="huemorProtip-button"></div></div>



<h3><strong>Use 3rd Party Tools To Augment Data</strong></h3>



<p>You can use an email address for more than just sending emails — it’s 2022, technology is available to help you get data on prospects even if they didn’t personally submit that data to you. You can integrate a tool like<a href="https://clearbit.com/"> ClearBit</a> with your CRM to automatically pull information based on an email address, such as insights like their full name, job title, and company demographic information.</p>

<h2><strong>Why &amp; When To Use Multi-Step Forms</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="633" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mult-step-Form-Example@2x-1024x633.jpg" alt="Mult step Form Example@2x" class="wp-image-30735" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mult-step-Form-Example@2x-1024x633.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mult-step-Form-Example@2x-300x185.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mult-step-Form-Example@2x-768x475.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mult-step-Form-Example@2x-1536x950.jpg 1536w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mult-step-Form-Example@2x-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mult-step-Form-Example@2x-36x22.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mult-step-Form-Example@2x-48x30.jpg 48w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mult-step-Form-Example@2x.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>So, as we’ve previously established, you should be keeping your contact forms as short as possible and to roughly one page. However, what if you absolutely need that data? Applying contact form best practices to a form that requires more than 10 entries requires the use of multi-step forms with multiple fields.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After being told that you only truly need a name and an email address on the contact form, you might be confused as to why you would ever need a form long enough that it requires multiple steps. The reasoning is simple — it depends heavily on the purpose of your contact form.</p>



<p>Imagine that you’re shopping around for an estimate on the value of your house. You see a real estate agency that promises a free online estimate, but the only thing their form asks is a name and an email address. What insight could they possibly offer you with only that information?</p>



<p>Multi-step forms are amazing solutions for longer forms, such as an application or registration form. They’re also a good way to get more information from your leads — starting with “low-friction” or “low-threat” (e.g. what service are you looking for?) fields. </p>



<p>These can engage them and allow you to ask more sensitive questions near the end when it’s less likely for them to back out because they’ve already invested time and effort. Multi-step forms that include a progress bar are also effective at getting users to complete forms, due to the “<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/500480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">endowed progress effect</a>.”</p>



<p>When making a multi-step form, the same conversion tips apply. You should keep each batch of fields short so you don’t overwhelm the user. </p>



<p>A case study from<a href="http://ventureharbour.com/multi-step-lead-forms-get-300-conversions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Venture Harbour</a> saw a 53% increase in conversion rate when they formatted 30+ questions in a four-step form. Data from<a href="https://www.formstack.com/resources/report-form-conversion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Formstack</a> backs this up — multi-step forms have a completion rate of 13.85%, compared to 4.53% on a single long form.</p>



<h2><strong>Why &amp; When To Use Embedded Forms</strong></h2>



<p>Many businesses keep separate<a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/service-page-design-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> service pages</a> and contact form pages. However, forms that are directly embedded in landing pages tend to outperform CTAs to open a separate contact form page. The reasoning is, as always, convenience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whenever you can, you should try and incorporate a contact form directly on key landing pages, ideally above the fold of the page and again at the bottom of the landing page. It should also stand out from the rest of the web page elements so your user can find it easily.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re following the previously highlighted conversion tips (i.e. keeping forms concise), then this should be relatively easy to accomplish from a design perspective.</p>



<h2><strong>How To Keep Forms Secure (Without Hurting Conversions)</strong></h2>



<p>On paper, Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart or CAPTCHAs are a great way to reduce spam and ensure you’re getting quality information from your form, but did you know that visible CAPTCHAs actually hurt conversion rates?&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="633" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x-1024x633.jpg" alt="How To Keep Forms Secure@2x" class="wp-image-30706" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x-1024x633.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x-300x185.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x-768x475.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x-1536x950.jpg 1536w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x-36x22.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x-48x30.jpg 48w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>According to this case study from<a href="https://moz.com/blog/captchas-affect-on-conversion-rates"> Moz</a>, having CAPTCHA on reduced the amount of spam conversions by 4.1% but companies could actually lose out on 3.2% of genuine conversions. This is likely because CAPTCHA has become too difficult and confusing, in an effort to combat the increasing sophistication of spambots. </p>



<p>It simply isn’t user-friendly — who wants to take the time to puzzle over a distorted set of letters or numbers and painstakingly type them out?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead of using CAPTCHA, you can look to alternatives that are convenient or invisible to the front-end user but still keep spam and brute force attacks at bay. One such example is Google’s<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/12/3/7325925/google-is-killing-captcha-as-we-know-it" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> reCAPTCHA</a>, which can be as simple as clicking a checkbox.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Tracking Performance &amp; Making Improvements</strong></h2>



<p>Whenever you make any type of changes to your contact forms, it is downright impossible to truly understand their impact without tracking performance. Here are three key tests and methods you should be using to track improvements:</p>



<h3><strong>Set Up Goals</strong></h3>



<p>Using<a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Google Analytics</a> (or your preferred analytics tool), make sure each form on your website has a unique goal attached to it for completion. This will give you a better understanding of the success rate of filling out these forms.</p>



<h3><strong>Use Behavior Tracking</strong></h3>



<p>Using tools like<a href="https://www.hotjar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Hotjar</a> or<a href="https://www.luckyorange.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> LuckyOrange</a> will provide you with a better understanding of how people are interacting with your contact forms in real-time. This could help you identify drop-off points or even bugs within the forms themselves.</p>



<h3><strong>Split Test</strong></h3>



<p>Tools like<a href="https://www.optimizely.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Optimizely</a>,<a href="https://vwo.com/platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> VWO</a>, and<a href="https://www.convert.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Convert</a> allow you to easily and effectively set up split tests. In these scenarios, you can run variations of form configurations side by side and understand how they truly are performing. </p>



<p>Split tests can help you pinpoint which elements of your contact forms help or harm your conversion rate. The more tests you perform, the better optimized your form will be by the end.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Wrapping Up</strong></h2>



<p>That finishes our rundown of contact form best practices. Contact forms are one of the biggest opportunities for businesses to improve both the quality and quantity of leads, so make sure you never neglect to optimize them. Always keep these three conversion tips in mind:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Keep them as concise as possible.</li><li>Use other methods to get the additional info you need.</li><li>Test and monitor all of your improvements to maximize your results.</li></ul>



<p>Remember, at the end of the day a good contact form is one that provides a pleasant user experience, and you can’t have that with clunky fields or long pages.

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Can you imagine how many websites consumers visit per year? By the time potential clients get to your site, they’ve likely seen hundreds of others. For this reason, these individuals already have a vague idea about design standards — exactly what to expect from a brand’s page in terms of appearance, design elements, web accessibility, and functionality.</p>



<span id="more-29668"></span>



<p>Because of their previous viewing experiences, their instincts tell them where to find logos, <a href="/blog/website-navigation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">navigation tools</a>, and scroll bars. These predispositions require brands to adhere to specific norms to elevate the user experience (UX) and user expectations.</p>



<p>With the help of our experienced web designers and design team, we made a list of design standards we follow to create standout websites for our clients. Read on to discover which ones you can apply to propel your business to new heights.</p>



<h2>What Are Web Design Standards?</h2>



<p>Web design standards are guidelines that cover the look and behind-the-scenes performance of sites. Sticking to such specifications allows you to offer clear and consistent messaging across all pages. Most recommendations relate to aesthetics, but not all of them do.</p>



<p>From the users’ point of view, such standards ensure predictable experiences that make navigation intuitive. Other benefits of using these suggestions include:</p>



<ul><li>Achieving good first impressions</li><li>Improving Google rankings</li><li>Minimizing bounce rates</li></ul>



<p>These benefits ultimately lead to a boost in leads, conversions, and revenue.</p>



<p>Remember that not all standards adhere to best design practices; they are two different things. However, we will only tackle factors that won’t harm your UX or Google rankings.</p>



<p>Are you ready to take your website to the next level? Let’s get right to it.</p>



<h2>1. Visually Consistent and Pleasing</h2>



<p>The latest <a href="https://www.sweor.com/firstimpressions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web design statistics</a> reveal that it only takes a whopping 0.05 seconds for visitors to decide whether they’ll stay or leave your site.</p>



<p>As much as people love saying, “Don’t judge a book by its cover,” they determine a brand’s credibility rather quickly. So, which factor affects these snap judgments the most? You guessed it: design! Consumers should take one look at your site and easily find what they need.</p>



<p>For example, check out <a href="https://arngren.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ARNGREN’s website</a>. It’s a Norwegian electronic company using a classified ads-type design. With a layout like this one, it’s hard to find products and navigate between pages.</p>



<p>Now, look at <a href="https://lusetabeauty.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luseta Beauty’s site</a>. We created this web page for a brand of affordable all-natural, salon-quality hair care products. The layout allows maximum visibility and movability, making scrolling fun and easy. (Check out our <a href="https://huemor.rocks/case-studies/luseta-beauty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">case study</a> to learn more about the design process of Luseta Beauty&#8217;s new website!)</p>



<p>As you can see, aesthetics matter. No matter how exceptional your products or services are, no one will believe you if your website doesn’t communicate your strengths to your end users.</p>



<p>Here are some pro tips to impose your online authority:</p>



<h3>Stay mobile-friendly:</h3>



<p>We all know mobile phones are super common, did you know that <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/2479/mobile-search/#dossierKeyfigures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mobile phone search users</a> in the U.S. have reached 200 million! If you don’t design for mobile devices, you miss countless opportunities to capture this population via search engines.</p>



<div class="huemorProtip-container" style="background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><h2 class="huemorProtip-title" style="color:black">Protip</h2><p style="color:black" class="huemorProtip-description">Consider various web browsers such as Google Chrome or Safari, test your website&#8217;s <a href="https://www.lambdatest.com/feature" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cross browser compatibility</a>!</p><div class="huemorProtip-button"></div></div>



<h3>Observe consistency:</h3>



<p>Use a holistic approach when building or revamping your website. Think of it as a whole instead of broken sections.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="666" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Visually-Consistent-and-Pleasing.png" alt="Visually Consistent and Pleasing" class="wp-image-29987" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Visually-Consistent-and-Pleasing.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Visually-Consistent-and-Pleasing-300x195.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Visually-Consistent-and-Pleasing-768x500.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Visually-Consistent-and-Pleasing-24x16.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Visually-Consistent-and-Pleasing-36x23.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Visually-Consistent-and-Pleasing-48x31.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3>Avoid too much clutter:</h3>



<p>While the ARNGREN example is a bit extreme, a minimalist website is the way to go. Check out these <a href="/blog/top-retail-website-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top retail websites</a> for inspiration.</p>



<h2>2. Intuitive Navigation</h2>



<p><a href="https://smallbiztrends.com/2019/01/easy-website-navigation-is-important.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A 2019 consumer research</a> shares jaw-dropping results — 94% of site visitors demand easily navigable websites from organizations. The modern consumer simply doesn’t have the patience to stay for non-standard placements, generic labels, and too many subcategories.</p>



<p>Apart from looking nice, websites should provide users with an intuitive flow that guides them every step of the way. If consumers have to find their way around your site, there’s something wrong with it. Below are web design standards and best practices most brands observe.</p>



<h3>Place the main navigation options in the header:</h3>



<p>Most websites do this, so consumers instinctively look at the top portion of your homepage to check your site’s contents. One great example includes the top left corner housing your company&#8217;s logo as this will help to increase user experience.</p>



<h3>Consider using a dropdown menu:</h3>



<p>This increases functionality as the visual hierarchy saves precious webpage space and makes the navigation process less overwhelming. However, make sure to use clear, concise labels. For example, using terms like products and solutions separately might confuse site visitors.</p>



<h3>If dropdown menus aren’t for you, try hamburger menus:</h3>



<p>Also called hamburger buttons, these tools are the three horizontal lines web pages use to offer more navigation options. Brands like Facebook, CNN, and MyFitnessPal use them.</p>

<h2>3. Visual Direction</h2>



<p>Visual direction separates good designers from great ones. It means controlling the eye movement of a visitor to encourage desired actions. You can achieve this by leaving visual cues without compromising your web page’s aesthetics. Check out these visual direction best practices:</p>



<h3>Use images to control movement:</h3>



<p>You can guide consumers toward the content you want them to see through proper picture placement. For example, you can use pictures of real people pointing at a product. Don’t use photos just to fill spaces; instead, use them with purpose.</p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-columns">

<h3>Lead the eye:</h3>



<p>Face pareidolia is the phenomenon wherein individuals naturally detect other people’s faces. Even when these faces are pictures on a website, visitors will follow their line of sight. For this reason, it’s essential to have models looking toward valuable information and never away from the page.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="706" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Visual-Direction.png" alt="Visual Direction" class="wp-image-29989" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Visual-Direction.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Visual-Direction-300x207.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Visual-Direction-768x530.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Visual-Direction-24x17.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Visual-Direction-36x25.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Visual-Direction-48x33.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3>Illustrate concepts with images:</h3>



<p>If you’re in the beauty industry and your unique selling proposition is that you have a three-in-one eye shadow-blush-lipstick product, it’s better to use photos than use 300 words to explain the idea. These <a href="/blog/top-beauty-website-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">standout beauty websites </a>will show you how to do it right.</p>



<h2>4. Social Proof</h2>



<p>Social proof is the process of using the actions and attitudes of other people to affect another’s behavior. Do you ever wonder why <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/word-of-mouth-marketing/#what-is-word-of-mouth-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">word of mouth marketing</a> impacts the purchasing decisions of 92% of consumers? It’s because there’s no higher form of social proof than recommendations from relatives and friends.</p>



<p>When building or upgrading the social proof portion of your site, remember that B2B and B2C web pages work differently. Here are essential factors to remember:</p>



<p>For B2B websites, <a href="/blog/how-to-use-testimonials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using testimonials</a> would be ideal. You can also use client logos, industry awards, and reviews from sites like G2 or Yelp. Check out these <a href="/blog/top-b2b-website-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">groundbreaking B2B websites</a> for inspiration.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="582" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Social-Proof.png" alt="Social Proof" class="wp-image-29990" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Social-Proof.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Social-Proof-300x171.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Social-Proof-768x437.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Social-Proof-24x14.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Social-Proof-36x20.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Social-Proof-48x27.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>On the other hand, product reviews, customer testimonials, and media features work best for B2C websites.</p>



<p>Focus on return on investment (ROI) for B2B sites and pain points for B2C ones.</p>



<h2>5. ADA Compliance</h2>



<p>Today, there are 61 million <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/infographic-disability-impacts-all.html#:~:text=61%20million%20adults%20in%20the,is%20highest%20in%20the%20South.." target="_blank" rel="noopener">disabled American adults</a>. Most of them have mobility, cognitive, hearing, and vision disabilities that make it challenging to gain information. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires websites to follow various design standards to address these individuals’ needs.</p>



<p>An <a href="/blog/our-secret-to-ada-site-compliance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADA-compliant website</a> ensures all users can access and navigate your site comfortably without discriminating anyone from using it for its intended purpose.</p>



<p>ADA broke down its website requirements into four categories. Web pages should be perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="378" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ADA-Compliance.png" alt="ADA Compliance" class="wp-image-29991" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ADA-Compliance.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ADA-Compliance-300x111.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ADA-Compliance-768x284.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ADA-Compliance-24x9.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ADA-Compliance-36x13.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ADA-Compliance-48x18.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3>Perceivable:</h3>



<p>Brands should provide all users with information that they can distinguish and understand. Creators should develop content that consumers can easily see or hear regardless of disability. For instance, you should find alternative options for CAPTCHA.</p>



<h3>Operable:</h3>



<p>Organizations should make their websites navigable for people with disabilities. They shouldn’t experience limited functionalities or unreasonable time limits. If disabled people buy things online, they should have enough time to input their card details and one-time validation PIN code.</p>



<h3>Understandable:</h3>



<p>Websites should avoid consumer error at all costs by explaining processes thoroughly and confirming financial information before submitting an order.</p>



<h3>Robust:</h3>



<p>Content should be robust enough for all users to interpret. For example, your site should allow visitors to determine the name of a user interface form.</p>



<h2>6. Short Contact Forms</h2>



<p>You might already have the aesthetics, navigation, social proof, and ADA compliance down. Don’t let long contact forms scare potential clients away. As much as possible, limit your questions to six and below.</p>



<p>Short contact forms on various landing pages convert more visitors. For this reason, we highly recommend removing anything unnecessary from these lead generation tools.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="822" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Short-Contact-Forms.png" alt="Short Contact Forms" class="wp-image-29992" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Short-Contact-Forms.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Short-Contact-Forms-300x241.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Short-Contact-Forms-768x617.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Short-Contact-Forms-24x19.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Short-Contact-Forms-36x29.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Short-Contact-Forms-48x39.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>7. Focused Call to Action</h2>



<p>A powerful call to action (CTA) can help build social following, customer databases, and close sales. It all depends on what you ask your clients to do. For best results, focus on a single CTA instead of providing options for desired actions.</p>



<p>If you want potential clients to try your product for free, say it. Having them choose between learning about your offer, signing up for your mailing list, or buying your product or service can be quite daunting. Multiple actions can end up turning prospects away.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="660" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Focused-Call-to-Action.png" alt="Focused Call to Action" class="wp-image-29993" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Focused-Call-to-Action.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Focused-Call-to-Action-300x193.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Focused-Call-to-Action-768x495.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Focused-Call-to-Action-24x15.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Focused-Call-to-Action-36x23.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Focused-Call-to-Action-48x31.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The homepage is the first thing people see when they visit a website, so it’s important to make a good first impression with your homepage content. Your homepage content will compel visitors who are interested in your services or products then convert them into leads and ultimately customers. It also helps you establish your authority in your niche.</p>



<span id="more-29670"></span>



<p>It’s important to learn that what your homepage offers is your most valuable asset, but it can be a nerve-wracking task to build one, especially when you don’t know where to start. The trick is to spend time on the important elements that provide people clarity on what you have to offer and how they can benefit from it.</p>



<h2>Logo</h2>



<p>The logo is the first element your visitors will see on your website&#8217;s homepage headline. Here are some important tips on how to create an effective logo and use it to your advantage:</p>



<h3>Make it eye-catching:</h3>



<p>Your logo is a way to brand yourself and your company. Hire an experienced designer to create one that instantly attracts attention and inspires visitors.</p>



<h3>Use optimal placement:</h3>



<p>The most common spot for a logo is the upper left corner of the page. This is where people tend to look first.</p>



<h3>Keep it simple:</h3>



<p>You want to make your logo pop without containing too many distracting elements. A minimalist design goes a long way.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="328" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Logo.png" alt="Logo" class="wp-image-30174" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Logo.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Logo-300x96.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Logo-768x246.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Logo-24x8.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Logo-36x12.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Logo-48x15.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3>Choose the right size:</h3>



<p>A bigger logo doesn’t necessarily create a better impression for your brand. In fact, this can even lead to visitors losing interest.</p>



<h3>Avoid animation:</h3>



<p>It can be tempting to animate your logo when you have the tools available. This negatively impacts user experience with the unnecessary visual noise.</p>



<h2>Site Menu and Navigation</h2>



<p>If you’ve ever been lost on a website or unable to even locate the menu icon, then you know what we’re talking about. Here are some ways to ensure that your <a href="/blog/website-navigation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visitors will be able to navigate your website</a> easily:</p>



<h3>Achieve consistency:</h3>



<p>Use a logical layout for all important features. This helps people know what to expect and leads them to where exactly they want to go. After all, you want your potential customers to be able to find all of the other pages of your website!</p>



<h3>Include lean options:</h3>



<p>The more options you have, the more confusing it is for visitors. A website with too many features can be difficult to navigate and even cause decision fatigue.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="663" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Keywords.png" alt="Keywords" class="wp-image-30175" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Keywords.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Keywords-300x194.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Keywords-768x497.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Keywords-24x16.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Keywords-36x23.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Keywords-48x31.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3>Describe each tab:</h3>



<p>Use on-point labels that reflect the exact service you’re offering. Instead of simply using “Services,” assign a specific name to avoid vague descriptions.</p>



<h3>Use the hamburger icon:</h3>



<p>This standard icon with the three horizontal lines is not only recognizable but also enhances site navigation and helps users quickly navigate your website. Place the word “Menu” beside it so it’s easier to locate.</p>



<h3>Provide access to your blog:</h3>



<p>Give users a chance to read your blog articles and access your work with previous clients. The blog adds value to their lives, and the case studies help you earn their trust.</p>



<h2>Be a Homepage Hero</h2>



<p>You may have noticed the large image on a homepage that captures your attention. This is what you call the “hero shot,” or your website’s main photo. Here are some ways to use it effectively:</p>



<h3>Let the hero image represent your brand:</h3>



<p>Because the hero shot is the biggest photo on your homepage, it should tell visitors what your brand is all about. The image should be able to explain right away how they can benefit from your products or services.</p>



<h3>Aim for coherence:</h3>



<p>Make sure that the hero shot you choose will blend well with your brand. An image that has little connection to your vision and values cannot inspire interaction.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="706" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Hero-Image-3.png" alt="Hero Image 3" class="wp-image-30176" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Hero-Image-3.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Hero-Image-3-300x207.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Hero-Image-3-768x530.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Hero-Image-3-24x17.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Hero-Image-3-36x25.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Hero-Image-3-48x33.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3>Keep it straightforward:</h3>



<p>Make it simple, make it fit, and make it your brand! What the photo represents must be easy enough to understand.</p>



<h3>Make it meaningful:</h3>



<p>A well-thought-out image helps highlight your company values. Choose an authentic shot relevant to your brand rather than a stock photo that appears fake.</p>



<h2>A Clear Value Proposition</h2>



<p>Ever heard of the term WIFM? It stands for, “What’s in it for me?” And, this is exactly what people have in mind the first time they see your homepage content. To create a clear-value proposition and in a few words, remember the following points:</p>



<h3>Make your brand the answer:</h3>



<p>People are always looking for value, and this is what they should get the first time they visit your website. You must let them know that you have something that can benefit them a great deal.</p>



<h3>Tie it with your hero shot:</h3>



<p>Place your tagline near the main image. Make sure the text properly exemplifies what the photo is portraying.</p>



<h3>Provide a clear message:</h3>



<p>Be clear about how you can help. This text must explain what you do and highlight the key points of your brand offering. Your website&#8217;s written content should include a clear description and only the most important and valuable information.</p>



<h3>Make it catchy:</h3>



<p>Your headline is what people read right away and associate with your business. A great example is Huemor’s “We Create Memorable Websites That Sell.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="666" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Clear-Value-Proposition.png" alt="Clear Value Proposition" class="wp-image-30177" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Clear-Value-Proposition.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Clear-Value-Proposition-300x195.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Clear-Value-Proposition-768x500.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Clear-Value-Proposition-24x16.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Clear-Value-Proposition-36x23.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Clear-Value-Proposition-48x31.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>And Action</h2>



<p>Every homepage content needs a well-worded CTA or “call to action.” Here are some ways to make your CTA work for you:</p>



<h3>Get your message across:</h3>



<p>An effective CTA creates a sense of need, an urgency that is hard to pass up. If your CTA can achieve this, you’re golden.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="486" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CTA-3.png" alt="CTA 3" class="wp-image-30179" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CTA-3.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CTA-3-300x142.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CTA-3-768x365.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CTA-3-24x11.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CTA-3-36x17.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CTA-3-48x23.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3>Use command verbs:</h3>



<p>Always use action words to establish your point and encourage visitors on what to do.</p>



<h3>Use the first-person:</h3>



<p>This perspective lets you take ownership of your brand. It also lends you a confident tone, which builds credibility.</p>



<h3>Emphasize the value:</h3>



<p>Mention the value that your visitors will get when they click on your CTA button. This should be clear from the get-go.</p>



<h3>Offer free tools:</h3>



<p>Give your visitors access to free materials like PDF downloads. Users will feel they’re getting great value and will be more likely to support your brand.</p>



<h3>Build your subscription:</h3>



<p>Encourage visitors to sign up and receive emails from your business. They may not be ready yet, but they certainly have great potential to become customers.</p>



<h2>More Proof?</h2>



<p>Your visitors will need convincing that your product or service is the one they’re looking for. This is where your proof building will come in handy for your homepage content:</p>



<h3>Publish social proof:</h3>



<p>Make positive statements from people who believe in your brand accessible. <a href="/blog/how-to-use-testimonials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Well-formatted testimonials help elevate your status</a> in your chosen field or niche.</p>



<h3>Use statistics:</h3>



<p>Numbers provide evidence of how well your product or service is doing. They offer a preview of your brand’s capacity to help.</p>



<h3>Provide images:</h3>



<p>Photos are another way to prove how much your brand is making a difference. They confirm how wide your reach is in terms of location and groups of people.</p>

<h2>Blogs and Resources</h2>



<p>Your blog is a direct route for convincing visitors that your product or service can be a huge game-changer for them. Here are ways to make blogging work for your brand:</p>



<h3>Write engaging posts:</h3>



<p>If you want to encourage visitors to read your content, write interesting articles. Use attention-grabbing titles and a story format that’s easy to follow.</p>



<h3>Make articles easy to find:</h3>



<p>If your blog posts are out of sight from the navigation bar, it will be hard to convince visitors of the value you can give them.</p>



<h3>Use a grid format:</h3>



<p>A gridlike setup offers a clean design for your blog, thus making articles easy to access. Feature posts with catchy featured images with descriptions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="486" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Blogs-and-Resources.png" alt="Blogs and Resources" class="wp-image-30181" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Blogs-and-Resources.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Blogs-and-Resources-300x142.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Blogs-and-Resources-768x365.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Blogs-and-Resources-24x11.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Blogs-and-Resources-36x17.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Blogs-and-Resources-48x23.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3>Provide a teaser:</h3>



<p>Include a section for your blog that highlights top posts or recent articles on your homepage. But, only give a preview and not too much information!</p>



<h3>Don’t forget your CTA:</h3>



<p>Use a “Read More!” CTA to ensure that visitors will end up clicking the link to your posts after reading the previews.</p>



<h2>Keywords</h2>



<p>Your homepage content should be SEO-friendly, meaning the keywords you use for all content are optimized and will show up on a standard search. Here are ways to win this technical game:</p>



<h3>Do your research:</h3>



<p>You can’t simply write content and expect people to quickly find your site on the first search. Use keywords that rank the highest and use them for your homepage.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="663" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Keywords-1.png" alt="Keywords 1" class="wp-image-30182" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Keywords-1.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Keywords-1-300x194.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Keywords-1-768x497.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Keywords-1-24x16.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Keywords-1-36x23.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Keywords-1-48x31.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3>Know where to put your keywords:</h3>



<p>Place keywords strategically in your title, headline, menu, alternative text for images, as well as your meta descriptions.</p>



<h3>Avoid overstuffing:</h3>



<p>Using keywords more than the recommended number of times can be counterproductive. You can use the right SEO tools to build a searchable homepage.</p>



<h2>Footer</h2>



<p>The footer requires an awesome design, yet it is one of the most overlooked parts of a homepage as the footer is a key element of your website homepage content. The footer is just as important as any other aspect because it contains the following elements:</p>



<h3>Contact information:</h3>



<p>This includes your company’s mobile and landline numbers.</p>



<h3>Location:</h3>



<p>This provides your registered business address and physical branches if applicable.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="378" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Footer.png" alt="Footer" class="wp-image-30183" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Footer.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Footer-300x111.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Footer-768x284.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Footer-24x9.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Footer-36x13.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Footer-48x18.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3>Social media platforms:</h3>



<p>These links will lead them to your company’s official Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest accounts, and more.</p>



<h3>Resources:</h3>



<p>If your company is partnered up with other platforms or organizations, this is where you encourage visitors to visit other related sites.</p>



<h3>Email sign-up:</h3>



<p>This is a perfect way to build your mailing list and generate leads.</p>



<h3>Final Call to Action or CTA:</h3>



<p>This is where you find the “Contact Us” link to invite people to send you a message and request more information or schedule a call to talk to someone from your team.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Alright, so here&#8217;s the scenario. You&#8217;re a marketing manager in charge of ensuring certain goals are accomplished for your organization.</p>



<span id="more-29674"></span>



<p>There&#8217;s a problem, though. You don&#8217;t have either the time or the budget to do a <a href="/blog/website-redesign" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complete website redesign</a>.</p>



<p>What do you do?</p>



<p>There are a ton of ways one can go about improving a website, but we&#8217;ve taken the liberty to narrow them down to the 10 things we feel will make the BIGGEST impact on your website WITHOUT having to redesign the entire thing from the ground up. So how do you improve your website? Get ready to ways to improve your website design!</p>



<h2>Make It Faster</h2>



<p>User experience is greatly influenced by the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/speed-up-a-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speed of a website</a>. <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/data-measurement/mobile-page-speed-new-industry-benchmarks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Google</a>, increasing loading times from one to three seconds raises the likelihood of a visitor abandoning the website by 32%.</p>



<p>Site speed also plays a vital role in conversion rates. In fact, <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-strategies/app-and-mobile/mobile-page-speed-conversion-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research by Google</a> reveals that conversions might drop by up to 20% for every second that a mobile page takes to load. Furthermore, faster websites can lift conversion rates by up to 40%.</p>



<p>In many cases, speeding up your website and website design can be relatively easy to do. Here are <a href="https://www.hostgator.com/blog/fix-slow-loading-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some quick fixes</a> that can make your site load faster:</p>



<ul><li>Compress and optimize your images and videos</li><li>Limit the amount that loads on a single page</li><li>Enable caching</li><li>Use a CDN</li></ul>



<p>Improving website overall page speed is critical for attracting visitors and keeping them interested.</p>



<div class="huemorProtip-container" style="background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><h2 class="huemorProtip-title" style="color:black">Protip</h2><p style="color:black" class="huemorProtip-description">If you&#8217;re interested in learning more about what we can do for you, check out our offers <a href="https://huemor.rocks/services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>!</p><div class="huemorProtip-button"></div></div>



<h2>Make It Consistent</h2>



<p>Design is all about consistency. The consistency of your website&#8217;s design and content is critical if you want to give your visitors a pleasant online experience. It can make the difference between a good and bad user experience.</p>



<p>Even if you&#8217;re not in love with your visual design, it may be made worse by being inconsistent. Make sure that fonts, font sizes, font weights, colors, treatments to elements such as corner rounding, and borders are consistent across all pages. This will improve how professional the website appears regardless of whether or not the web design is the best it can be.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="543" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/consistency-glossier.jpg" alt="consistency glossier" class="wp-image-30200" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/consistency-glossier.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/consistency-glossier-300x159.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/consistency-glossier-768x407.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/consistency-glossier-24x13.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/consistency-glossier-36x19.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/consistency-glossier-48x25.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption> <a href="https://www.glossier.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glossier</a> </figcaption></figure>



<p>For example, consistency is evident on the <a href="https://www.glossier.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glossier</a> website because it employs a color palette that matches its products. It is also able to add a few splashes of color to each page without going excessive or deviating from its identity. Also make the most of your website&#8217;s white space, do not over crowd your website with unneeded content but also do not leave blank canvas blank!</p>



<h2>Improve Your Opening Statement</h2>



<p>The copy on your homepage has a significant impact on its success. It&#8217;ll be the first thing visitors see when they come to your website and can be used as a brief &#8220;elevator pitch&#8221; to explain the purpose of your site. As a result, your website&#8217;s opening statement must be engaging.</p>



<p>You should have a clear opening statement that makes it obvious what you do, who you do it for, and why you do it. If you don&#8217;t, then you&#8217;re starting off on the wrong foot with your potential customers. Improving this statement will immediately help prospective customers connect with your company.</p>



<p>For instance, <a href="http://kabertech.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaber Tech</a> features an excellent opening statement on their website. They have a catchy headline and a statement that illustrates what makes their products different.</p>



<h2>Re-organize Your Website Navigation</h2>



<p>One of the most crucial aspects of a website is its navigation. It helps visitors quickly and effortlessly discover the content they&#8217;re looking for, such as a blog post or a product page.</p>



<p>To make your website navigation effective, make sure all of your key pages are being represented. What are those key pages? These are areas of your site that are popular with visitors. You can use Google Analytics to help you understand what those pages are. Using the <a href="https://measureschool.com/navigation-report-google-analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Navigation Summary Report feature</a>, you&#8217;ll learn which pages people go to the most. This also ensures that the navigation is intuitive to how your customers would browse the website.</p>



<p>Another crucial factor is to make sure the navigation isn&#8217;t overwhelming. The navigation menu on your website is not the place for amusing gimmicks. Use the cleanest design and wording possible to ensure that your audience understands what you&#8217;re trying to convey. In addition, the adage &#8220;less is more&#8221; applies. Don&#8217;t bombard guests with too many items on your menu.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="543" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/navigation-gleamin.jpg" alt="navigation gleamin" class="wp-image-30199" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/navigation-gleamin.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/navigation-gleamin-300x159.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/navigation-gleamin-768x407.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/navigation-gleamin-24x13.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/navigation-gleamin-36x19.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/navigation-gleamin-48x25.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption> <a href="http://gleamin.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gleamin</a> (Check out our <a href="https://huemor.rocks/case-studies/gleamin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">case study</a>) </figcaption></figure>



<p>Over time websites grow, but often navigation systems don&#8217;t grow with them. As such, it&#8217;s essential to update your website navigation regularly for the best possible user experience.</p>



<p>An example of a website that has excellent navigation is <a href="https://www.stories.com/en_usd/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Other Stories</a>. The site features clear navigation options that allow users to easily find different product categories.</p>



<div class="huemorProtip-container" style="background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><h2 class="huemorProtip-title" style="color:black">Protip</h2><p style="color:black" class="huemorProtip-description">Check out our article for more detailed tips on how to design a truly effective <a href="/blog/website-navigation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">website navigation</a>.</p><div class="huemorProtip-button"></div></div>



<h2>Add Social Proof</h2>



<p>Your website will soar if you provide social proof. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2021/10/07/4-powerful-ways-to-show-social-proof-on-your-website/?sh=5c71a0d92479" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social proof</a> is a marketing approach based on the premise that if people witness others doing something, they are more inclined to do it themselves. If a shopper is undecided about what you&#8217;re offering, they will frequently look or ask around to see what others say about it before making a purchase. Potential buyers get the impression that they&#8217;re not by themselves. <a href="https://geekflare.com/social-proof-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social proof</a> lets them know that many people believe in the brand and use it to their advantage. As a result, they have many good reasons to put it to use for themselves as well.</p>



<p>One way to show social proof on your website is to add testimonials or reviews. This can help you gain a lot of new customers. In fact, <a href="https://bizrateinsights.com/resources/shopper-survey-report-the-impact-reviews-have-on-consumers-purchase-decisions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">91% of customers</a> read internet reviews before purchasing something. Furthermore, testimonials can boost <a href="https://www.impactbnd.com/blog/whats-changed-with-social-proof-in-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sales page conversions by 34%</a>.</p>



<div class="huemorProtip-container" style="background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><h2 class="huemorProtip-title" style="color:black">Protip</h2><p style="color:black" class="huemorProtip-description">Want to learn more out how to use use testimonials on your website? Read more <a href="/blog/how-to-use-testimonials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>!</p><div class="huemorProtip-button"></div></div>



<p>Including ratings and reviews on your website allows your visitors to see what other people have to say. Make sure they&#8217;re on crucial pages, that they serve to reinforce what you&#8217;re offering, and that they were made recently by previous customers.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.wearfigs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Figs</a> demonstrates how social proof can be used on a website. Their product pages feature a tab where customers can check ratings and reviews.</p>



<h2>Simplify Contact Forms</h2>



<p>An effective contact form is one of the most crucial parts of your website. A potential customer has no idea how trustworthy you and your product are. They might have concerns about how to use your product, or they might want to put your customer support to the test by asking a query and seeing what kind of response they get.</p>



<p>Because contact forms are used to link online visitors with their objectives, design and user experience can heavily influence conversion rates. Here are some ways to simplify your contact forms.</p>



<h3>Shorter Contact Forms Perform Better</h3>



<p>When a form has too many fields, it can be too much for people to handle, and they may abandon it. Reducing the number of needed fields makes it easier to fill out the form and prevents the user from feeling overwhelmed. According to <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/contact-form-conversion-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QuickSprout research</a>, a three-field form had a 25% conversion rate. Those percentages were lowered to 20% for up to 5 fields and 15% for more than 6 fields. As a result, the maximum number of fields should be 5, and the tab order should be correct.</p>



<h3>Keep What You Need To Know to the Bare Minimum</h3>



<p>As a general rule, people are reluctant to share personal details such as their contact number or address. Asking for these details can result in a high rate of form abandonment. According to <a href="https://komarketing.com/resources/b2b-web-usability-report-2015/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KoMarketing</a>, phone numbers are the most common piece of information that consumers do not want to enter on a form, at 58%. This is even more relevant nowadays, given the rise in the number of spam calls. Home address closely follows at 53%.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="839" height="539" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Contact-form-ARM-1.jpg" alt="Contact form ARM 1" class="wp-image-30198" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Contact-form-ARM-1.jpg 839w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Contact-form-ARM-1-300x193.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Contact-form-ARM-1-768x493.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Contact-form-ARM-1-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Contact-form-ARM-1-36x23.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Contact-form-ARM-1-48x31.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 839px) 100vw, 839px" /><figcaption> <a href="https://arm-creative.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ARM Creative</a> (Check out our <a href="https://huemor.rocks/case-studies/arm-creative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">case study</a>) </figcaption></figure>



<h3>Less Friction = More Conversions</h3>



<p>When designing a contact form, you should focus on making it as easy as possible for people to get in touch with you. Ensure that the user can quickly and progressively move through the fields by arranging the tab order. The final tab arrangement of the Submit and Cancel buttons is critical to avoid users from mistakenly canceling the form. Another option to reduce friction is to use in-line validation. Before submitting an inquiry, certain Javascripts can notify visitors if their email address is incorrect. Nothing is more frustrating than having to find an error after you&#8217;ve already tried to submit your data.</p>



<h2>Add New Ways To Capture Contact Information</h2>



<p>Not everyone visiting your website will be ready to buy, but they may be in the future. As such, it will be to your advantage if you can collect the contact information of potential leads. Gathering email addresses from your website visitors is vital to building a community of loyal customers. Email marketing has also been proven to have one of the highest returns on investment among digital marketing strategies at <a href="https://www.lyfemarketing.com/blog/email-marketing-roi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">122%</a>.</p>



<p>Here are some improvements you can make on your site that can create additional opportunities for people to reveal who they are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Use newsletter opt-in forms on your website:</strong> Creating opt-in forms that let users submit their email and sign up for your emails is the easiest and quickest way to gather email addresses.</li><li><strong>Add new forms that offer specific resources or content:</strong> This might be in the form of an eBook, white paper, webinar, or anything else that provides consumers with essential knowledge.</li></ul>



<h2>Create New Content</h2>



<p>Quality content distinguishes your website from the competition and sends the right message to your customers&#8217; hearts and minds. Your website&#8217;s success is driven mainly by its content. As such, you need to focus on creating new content relevant to your target audience. This could be new service pages, new case studies, white papers, ebooks, and blog posts. Fresh content shows you&#8217;re still moving forward, are active, and are a successful business.</p>



<p>Building relationships with your customers is one of the main benefits of producing quality content. You&#8217;ll be able to answer their inquiries and engage with them. Content has the power to create pleasant customer experiences and encourage them to return for more.</p>



<h2>Update Photos and Videos</h2>



<p>Audiovisual elements such as photographs, illustrations, and videos look fantastic on a website and help engage visitors by breaking up text-heavy sections. However, keeping your media up-to-date is also crucial in improving website performance.</p>



<p>Check the corporate headshots on your site. Are they more than five years out of date? If so, then it&#8217;s time to update them. Posting new photos of projects and facilities can also help show growth.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/644959901?h=ee6c13e634&amp;dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption> <a href="https://agamerica.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AgAmerica</a> (Check out our <a href="https://huemor.rocks/case-studies/ag-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">case study</a>) </figcaption></figure>



<p>Make sure your visual elements are of the highest quality and relevance. Take note of anything that appears grainy, pixelated, or out-of-date. You can come across photos that aren&#8217;t relevant anymore or aren&#8217;t consistent with your current branding. Removing or replacing these elements can give your website a new and fresh look. Even if your website template isn&#8217;t brand new, new images and videos can still elevate your website.</p>



<h2>Clean-Up 404&#8217;s</h2>



<p>A 404 error is issued when a server is unable to locate the precise URL that the browser has requested. It&#8217;s the dreaded screen that reads: &#8220;this page cannot be found.&#8221; Individually, 404 errors may appear insignificant, but their cumulative effect on a site can be severe. 404 errors on a business website are a surefire way to lose money and irritate visitors at the same time.</p>

<p>First and foremost, 404 errors hurt SEO. Google and other search engines won&#8217;t index pages that return a 404 error code because it means the page doesn&#8217;t exist. Furthermore, they also hurt user experience. 404 errors can be frustrating for visitors and cause them to leave a website. Because of this, you&#8217;ll see a rise in the bounces and exit rates of your site. Customers and sales can potentially be lost due to 404 errors.</p>



<p>For these reasons, you must identify and fix these broken links. You can achieve this using tools like <a href="https://ahrefs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ahrefs</a>.</p>

<p>Are you wondering how to use testimonials to effectively draw prospective customers to your website? More importantly, are you wondering why you need customer testimonials on your website in the first place? All great questions, so let&#8217;s dive right in!</p>



<p>Getting the trust of your audience, as well as potential buyers is the most important part of getting more conversions. To do this, you need to use customer testimonials. Below are a few tips and testimonial examples to help your website (and, ultimately, your business):</p>



<span id="more-29676"></span>



<div class="ChapterFullwidth" style="background-image:url(https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-form">
<a id="chapter 1"></a>
</div><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">CHAPTER 1</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">What is the Goal of a Testimonial?</h2></div></div>



<p>Testimonials are used to boost the confidence of your prospective customers. Seeing that your products or services are reliable, they will trust your business more and the quality that it has. Testimonials are often used to generate leads and attain new customers for this reason.</p>



<p>Along with this, testimonials build trust with your audience because they back up the claims you’ve made about what your business does best. Anybody can say “my products are the best on the market.” But can everyone prove it? More often than not, no. Testimonials are a way to stand out in an industry with a lot of sales claims and limited data &#8212; or perhaps false data &#8212; to back them up.</p>



<div class="ChapterFullwidth" style="background-image:url(https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-form">
<a id="chapter 2"></a>
</div><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">CHAPTER 2</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">Why are Testimonials Effective?</h2></div></div>



<p>Testimonials lead to sales for two main reasons:</p>



<h3>They Add a Human Quality</h3>



<p>A lot of data can feel very impersonal. While you can prove to the world that you have X number of 5-star reviews, it’s the content of those reviews that really matter to customers. It’s how they can identify with your product or service and see themselves using it.</p>



<p>Testimonials are, of course, not reviews. But in a similar sense, the content of these testimonials will matter to your customers. Providing a human quality will allow them to relate with or sympathize with the experiences of the customers in testimonials, especially if these testimonials discuss pain points. Seeing that someone else found the solution in your business will entice them to do the same.</p>



<h3>They Create Social Proof</h3>



<p>You’ve probably heard of <a href="https://www.dynamicyield.com/glossary/social-proof/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social proof</a> before, but just as a recap, social proof is when someone uses a product or service, and then creates a chain reaction of people doing the same thing. This does not have to be a celebrity or a billionaire. It just needs to be someone that people respect and trust. Getting a testimonial from a trusted source will inevitably send customers your way looking to be like that person, or be liked by society.</p>



<p>Alternatively, a large amount of testimonials can create social proof, since people will think, “Since everyone else is doing it, I should be, too.” Ideally, you should have a mix of testimonials from people that others look up to, as well as ordinary people that fit your target demographic.</p>



<div class="ChapterFullwidth" style="background-image:url(https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-form">
<a id="chapter 3"></a>
</div><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">CHAPTER 3</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">Testimonials vs. Data and Statistics</h2></div></div>



<p>When customers want to see just how honest you are as a company, they will look for two key pieces of evidence — testimonials or data and statistics. In order to build a website that truly captures your viewers’ attention, you will need to have both placed strategically on your website.</p>



<h3>Testimonials</h3>



<p>This kind of evidence shows the quality of certain products and services, focusing on what appeals to the hearts and emotions of their target audience. As mentioned, testimonials will always come from someone who has already tried the product or service, which means they are speaking from experience.</p>

<h3>Data and Statistics</h3>



<p>This involves qualitative evidence. Think graphs, charts, figures, and the like. For example, you could conduct a survey showing how many customers are satisfied with your services.</p>

</div><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">CHAPTER 4</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">How to Get a Great Testimonial</h2></div></div>



<h2>How to Get a Great Testimonial</h2>



<p>Now that you understand how testimonials work and just how effective they can be, you probably want some on your own website. This is a great idea but if you don’t have a customer base just yet, this won’t be easy to do. Nevertheless, you can put systems in place to get testimonials in the future.</p>



<h3>Do an Amazing Job</h3>



<p>This one is kind of obvious, but it’s the most important thing you can do for your company and brand. If you want to get good testimonials throughout your website, you have to deliver a great product or experience for your customers. Not just once or twice, but consistently — doing this each time a customer makes a purchase will lead to testimonials down the line.</p>



<h3>Ask for Testimonials</h3>



<p>A lot of companies assume that testimonials will willingly come to them, but this isn’t actually true. People will usually have better things to do than take the time to sit down and write something nice about a product they used or a service they booked. The best way to compel people to do this is to have a set of processes to ask for positive reviews with every satisfactory customer experience.</p>



<p>Ensure that you have a team to take charge of customer interactions, such as CSRs or managers, who can follow a clear set of processes. We suggest starting with fans who love your products and services. Because of this, they could already be interested or willing to help you in any way they can. All that’s left to do is ask.</p>



<h4>Email Example</h4>



<p>Whenever you’re sending an email asking for a testimonial, it needs to be concise, yet polite. A long email will confuse the sendee, and a rude email will turn them away. As such, these are the two highest priorities when sending an email.</p>



<p>Here is a template email for your reference:</p>



<p><em>Dear ____,</em></p>



<p><em>Would you be alright with writing us a short testimonial? We’re looking to update our website, and it would help us out. I can send you something to base it off of, or you can just write us a couple of sentences relating to your experiences with our company.</em></p>



<p><em>Please don’t feel obligated to do this, however. If you’d like to decline, that is completely okay. Just let me know.</em></p>



<p><em>Thank you!</em></p>



<p>Naturally, you’ll want to adjust the tone of this template depending on the way your company is branded. You might want it to be more formal than it already is, or more conversational.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, no matter how they respond, following this guideline will allow you to get what you came for nine times out of ten &#8212; a testimonial.</p>



<h3>Use Third-Party Sites for Testimonials</h3>



<p>It’s a good idea to have your customers use third-party websites where they can leave testimonials or reviews. While these third-party sites can vary depending on the industry you’re in, there are many common platforms that you can rely on, such as:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.google.com/business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Business</a></li><li><a href="https://www.g2.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">G2</a></li><li><a href="https://www.yelp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yelp</a></li><li><a href="https://foursquare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foursquare</a></li><li><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TripAdvisor</a></li><li><a href="https://www.zomato.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zomato</a></li></ul>



<p>Doing this will allow you to broaden the exposure your website receives while adding another layer of authenticity for your business. By maintaining your profile on third-party sites, you can show audiences that you are a legitimate business by having recent photos, current information, and top reviews.</p>



<p>Furthermore, having an active account that shows up-to-date information will boost results within search engines. As a result, you’ll gain the attention of more people and attract more visitors to your company and brand.</p>



<p>Along with this, third-party websites will usually display snippets to visually represent your website as soon as search results come in.</p>



<p>Bonus review source &#8211; social media! Go through your social media feed to see what feedback previous consumers have shared. This is a great way to collect feedback from real people as well! Just make sure your customer is okay with you sharing their thoughts as you want to continue to build trust for your brand.</p>

<p>Now you’re probably wondering how to write a testimonial. This will be useful when you’re making those drafts inside your emails to send to your customers. Here are a few tips on how to write effective testimonials:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="400" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Ag-America-Testimonial-1.jpg" alt="Ag America Testimonial 1" class="wp-image-30218" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Ag-America-Testimonial-1.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Ag-America-Testimonial-1-300x117.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Ag-America-Testimonial-1-768x300.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Ag-America-Testimonial-1-24x9.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Ag-America-Testimonial-1-36x14.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Ag-America-Testimonial-1-48x19.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://huemor.rocks/case-studies/ag-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-size: 12px;">AgAmerica Case Study</span></a></figcaption></figure>



<h3>Only Include Testimonials that Have Been Received Ethically</h3>



<p>This is probably another obvious piece of advice but we’ll say it anyway: Don’t invent fake testimonials. Every testimonial on your website should be 100% authentic.</p>



<p>This doesn’t mean you can paraphrase something a customer said once, either. It needs to be straight from them, and with their permission.</p>



<h3>A Good Testimonial is Concise</h3>



<p>A short and concise testimonial is the best way to deliver a message that you want people to know about. Ideally, it will have between 30 to 50 words to ensure that people will read it, rather than find a shorter one that they can easily comprehend.</p>



<p>Avoid using super-long messages — while your customers may love your work, be sure to ask for their approval to edit these down to an appropriate amount.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="400" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Concise-testimonial-1.jpg" alt="Concise testimonial 1" class="wp-image-30220" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Concise-testimonial-1.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Concise-testimonial-1-300x117.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Concise-testimonial-1-768x300.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Concise-testimonial-1-24x9.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Concise-testimonial-1-36x14.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Concise-testimonial-1-48x19.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://huemor.rocks/case-studies/coverfx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CoverFX Case Study</a></figcaption></figure>



<h3>A Good Testimonial is Direct</h3>



<p>As mentioned, you don’t need paragraphs and paragraphs of good words about your company. Upfront and direct messages will have more of an impact on those who read them compared to long messages. Long messages will only drown potential buyers in words, creating confusion. A testimonial that’s straight to the point makes it more understandable for your audience.</p>

<h3>A Good Testimonial is Authentic</h3>



<p>It only makes sense that the more information there is in a testimonial, the more authentic and credible it is. A testimonial should have a person’s name, title, picture, and in some cases, their company.</p>



<p>Along with this, the best testimonials will show the personality of the person leaving them, conveying emotion and leaving readers to experience their happiness with the product or service secondhand.</p>

<h3>Some Aren’t Written At All</h3>



<p>Video testimonials are a great way to present the story of how a person truly feels about the service or product you offer. When a potential buyer sees someone, hears their tone, and views their mannerisms, it can truly add a lot of credibility.</p>



<p>Visual endorsements are also more engaging. According to Forbes, viewers are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/yec/2017/07/13/how-to-incorporate-video-into-your-social-media-strategy/?sh=5e4f3bda7f2e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">95% more likely</a> to understand and keep the message of a video compared to text. It is all about tailoring your content to what your potential customers want to know from real people and clients. This increases the likelihood they will purchase a product or service from your business as well as help to boost sales.</p>

<p>While having testimonials is great, you shouldn’t just post them for the sake of having them on your website. You also need to make sure that we have a few key components in place to ensure that you don’t lose your credibility. Here are a few things to consider:</p>



<h3>Is it Relevant?</h3>



<p>Be sure to check if the testimonial actually talks about your business — it’s easy to fill pages with testimonials but do they actually matter to your business today? Make sure that they capture your audiences’ attention by picking out only the most relevant pieces for your business.</p>



<p>A relevant testimonial will talk about the specific products and services you offer or anything new that you will soon be offering. They will also remain consistent regarding who you are as a company and what you represent.</p>



<h3>Is there an Identifiable Source?</h3>



<p>As mentioned, a credible testimonial will come from a source that you can identify and shouldn’t be anonymous.</p>



<p>For B2B companies, a testimonial will ideally have:</p>



<ul><li>A person’s name</li><li>Their job title</li><li>Their company</li><li>Their photo</li></ul>



<p>However, if you find that a customer may not want to include a photo, a logo of their company would suffice as well. Here is an example of what a testimonial for B2B companies with an identifiable source should look like:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Quirk-b2b-testimonial.jpg" alt="Quirk b2b testimonial" class="wp-image-30223" width="840" height="328" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Quirk-b2b-testimonial.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Quirk-b2b-testimonial-300x117.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Quirk-b2b-testimonial-768x300.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Quirk-b2b-testimonial-24x9.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Quirk-b2b-testimonial-36x14.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Quirk-b2b-testimonial-48x19.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://huemor.rocks/case-studies/quirk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-size: 12px;">Quirk Creative Case Study</span></a></figcaption></figure>



<p>For D2C companies, a testimonial will ideally have:</p>



<ul><li>A person’s name</li><li>Their photo</li></ul>



<p>Here’s an example of these kinds of testimonials for D2C companies:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="838" height="375" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Gleamin-D2C-testimonial-1-2.jpg" alt="Gleamin D2C testimonial 1 2" class="wp-image-30224" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Gleamin-D2C-testimonial-1-2.jpg 838w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Gleamin-D2C-testimonial-1-2-300x134.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Gleamin-D2C-testimonial-1-2-768x344.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Gleamin-D2C-testimonial-1-2-24x11.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Gleamin-D2C-testimonial-1-2-36x16.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Gleamin-D2C-testimonial-1-2-48x21.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 838px) 100vw, 838px" /><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://gleamin.com">gleamin.com</a></figcaption></figure>



<div class="ChapterFullwidth" style="background-image:url(https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-form">
<a id="chapter 7"></a>
</div><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">CHAPTER 7</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">Where to Include Testimonials?</h2></div></div>



<p>No matter the kind of industry you belong to or the nature of your business, there are places on your website where testimonials need to be to produce the most desirable results. Here are just a few of those areas:</p>



<h3>Key Landing Pages</h3>



<p>Placing testimonials on your key landing pages will provide the best area for potential customers or buyers to see just how great your brand or company is. Also, having testimonials on your products or services pages will provide you with the opportunity to back up any claims you might have.</p>



<div class="huemorProtip-container" style="background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><h2 class="huemorProtip-title" style="color:black">Protip</h2><p style="color:black" class="huemorProtip-description">Much like in this example, ensure that your claims are paired with relevant testimonials. Doing this will greatly boost the effectiveness of these claims.</p><div class="huemorProtip-button"></div></div>



<h3>Your Success Stories / Portfolio / Case Studies</h3>



<p>This is where you can provide both quantitative data in the form of data &amp; statistics of outcomes as well as qualitative data using customer testimonials. As previously mentioned, having a combination of both will win over your customers’ hearts and minds.</p>



<div class="hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed" style="width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 1920px; max-height: 1080px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;">
<div class="hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;"><iframe class="hs-responsive-embed-iframe" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;" src="//player.vimeo.com/video/642720112?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=8dc7dc&amp;background=1" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-service="vimeo" width="1920" height="1080" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
</div>



<h3>Contact Pages and Checkout</h3>



<p>Having a testimonial within your <a href="https://smashballoon.com/how-to-display-testimonials-on-your-website/#reviews-on-contact-pages" target="_blank" rel="noopener">checkout or contact page</a> can be the final touch of persuasion that you need. This could just be what you need to push someone to make the decision to buy your products or services. To make this as effective as possible, make sure to save your best testimonials for last.</p>

<p>A retail website is an online platform maintained by a retailer to sell goods and services to a particular target audience. However, having one set up doesn&#8217;t automatically mean that retailers can immediately haul in customers and earn profits.</p>



<p>Web design is crucial when creating an effective retail website. A good retail website is all about accessibility, responsiveness, and the use of high-quality media, such as images and videos. A retail website should provide the best experience to users so they can <a href="/blog/website-navigation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">convert into customers</a>.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve compiled a list of the best retail websites today to help you craft yours. Our company has long been creating websites for businesses worldwide, and the retail websites below meet our criteria for user experience, high-quality content, optimization for mobile use, and accessibility.</p>



<span id="more-29678"></span>



<h2>1. <a href="https://www.allbirds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Allbirds</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="600" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Allbirds.jpg" alt="Allbirds" class="wp-image-30229" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Allbirds.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Allbirds-300x176.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Allbirds-768x450.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Allbirds-24x14.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Allbirds-36x21.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Allbirds-48x28.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Allbirds&#8217; website makes it to our list because the tone of their platform is friendly, easily builds trust, and encourages users to buy from them. Their shopping cart gives customers features free shipping to their customers. Their website design is simple yet effective. It draws the eyes to the unique images present on every webpage and allows for user interaction and user experience.</p>



<p>Even first-time users won&#8217;t have any problems using the website because it&#8217;s easy to navigate and the webpages highlight various products!</p>



<h2>2. <a href="https://swallowtailtea.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swallowtail Tea</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="675" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Swallowtail-Tea.jpg" alt="Swallowtail Tea" class="wp-image-30230" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Swallowtail-Tea.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Swallowtail-Tea-300x198.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Swallowtail-Tea-768x506.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Swallowtail-Tea-24x16.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Swallowtail-Tea-36x24.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Swallowtail-Tea-48x32.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Users will be encouraged to buy tea from Swallowtail Tea&#8217;s website because it uses a very clean design that goes well with the calming effects of tea. Although the website&#8217;s design is subtle, any information a user might want is available, from a list of on-sale items and the company’s <a href="/blog/about-us-page-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener">About Us page</a> to various teas and merchandise.</p>



<p>The product photography is on point! Each of the product images highlights the product in their online store.</p>



<h2>3. <a href="https://www.glossier.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glossier</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="591" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Glossier-1.jpg" alt="Glossier 1" class="wp-image-30231" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Glossier-1.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Glossier-1-300x173.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Glossier-1-768x443.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Glossier-1-24x14.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Glossier-1-36x21.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Glossier-1-48x28.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Glossier&#8217;s website showcases &#8220;consistency&#8221; because it uses a color palette similar to the colors of its products. It also managed to add little pops of colors to every webpage without going overboard or steering away from its brand.</p>



<p>Aside from being aesthetically pleasing, every page of the website is also informative as they display vital information that users should know about the products — from its benefits and available sizes to instructions on how to use them.</p>



<p>Another reason Glossier is on our list is because they are an ecommerce platform that allows for users to find the products they are looking for in a short amount of time due to their overall organized web design.</p>



<h2>4. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="476" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Amazon.jpg" alt="Amazon" class="wp-image-30232" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Amazon.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Amazon-300x139.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Amazon-768x357.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Amazon-24x11.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Amazon-36x17.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Amazon-48x22.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>One noteworthy feature of Amazon&#8217;s website is it displays a lot of shipping and product information without making the platform look cluttered. Users can easily find products on the website as everything is categorized properly.</p>



<p>Amazon&#8217;s website also shows products inspired by a user’s browsing history. This means that if a user searched for pellet grills, the website will then display hardwood pellets, dripping pails, and beef rubs.</p>



<h2>5. <a href="https://perkyjerky.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perky Jerky</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="651" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Perky-Jerky.jpg" alt="Perky Jerky" class="wp-image-30233" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Perky-Jerky.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Perky-Jerky-300x191.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Perky-Jerky-768x488.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Perky-Jerky-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Perky-Jerky-36x23.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Perky-Jerky-48x31.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Perky Jerky&#8217;s website stays true to its name — it uses high-quality images and bold color palettes to make the page feel and look cheerful. When accessed through a smartphone, the website also shows animations that don&#8217;t interfere with the navigation or experience of the users.</p>



<p>The products on the website are categorized so users can easily find what they&#8217;re looking for — whether they want to purchase turkey jerky, beef jerky, or vegan jerky!</p>



<h2>6. <a href="https://www.rei.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REI</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="576" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/REI.jpg" alt="REI" class="wp-image-30234" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/REI.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/REI-300x169.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/REI-768x432.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/REI-24x14.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/REI-36x20.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/REI-48x27.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The use of earthy tones on their website matches the brand of REI. Headers and footers are properly highlighted using bold shades of green, and descriptions are visible as these are presented in solid black colors.</p>



<p>If there&#8217;s one thing the website can improve on, it&#8217;s the number of categories presented on a webpage. Some users find the header and footer navigations too congested, which can become an issue down the road.</p>



<h2>7. <a href="https://tomasthan.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thomas Than</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="481" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Thomas-Than.jpg" alt="Thomas Than" class="wp-image-30235" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Thomas-Than.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Thomas-Than-300x141.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Thomas-Than-768x361.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Thomas-Than-24x11.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Thomas-Than-36x17.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Thomas-Than-48x23.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Thomas Than&#8217;s website welcomes users to their website with a choice of which version of the website users want to visit. The cleanliness of Thomas Than&#8217;s website makes it stand out from the competition. Although the website is filled with attractive models, the focus remains on the products.</p>



<p>The products on the website are also categorized into just two — men and women. This makes it more convenient for users to browse through different products and find what they&#8217;re looking for within minutes.</p>



<h2>8. <a href="https://periodaisle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aisle</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="512" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Aisle-1.jpg" alt="Aisle 1" class="wp-image-30236" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Aisle-1.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Aisle-1-300x150.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Aisle-1-768x384.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Aisle-1-24x12.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Aisle-1-36x18.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Aisle-1-48x24.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The use of bold colors is very prevalent on Aisle&#8217;s website. Bright colors of green, yellow, orange, and blue can be seen throughout the website. Even with these colors, though, the website remains clean as the colors are used strategically to create sections.</p>



<p>Another cool thing about the website is that its cursor changes to a &#8220;buy now&#8221; sign when users hover over the products. This quirky addition brings more character to the website and allows users to have a little bit of fun as they navigate through it.</p>



<h2>9. <a href="https://bitetoothpastebits.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bite</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="512" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Bite-1.jpg" alt="Bite 1" class="wp-image-30237" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Bite-1.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Bite-1-300x150.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Bite-1-768x384.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Bite-1-24x12.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Bite-1-36x18.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Bite-1-48x24.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Bite&#8217;s website uses a softer color palette with shades of blue and gray but still manages to create a bold and fun-looking platform. The color choices on the website create a calming effect that perfectly describes the benefits of using Bite products.</p>



<p>The animation on the web pages is also a nice touch because it brings more appeal without distracting the users from reading the information presented online.</p>



<h2>10. <a href="https://www.puravidabracelets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pura Vida</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="600" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Pura20Vida.jpg" alt="Pura20Vida" class="wp-image-30238" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Pura20Vida.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Pura20Vida-300x176.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Pura20Vida-768x450.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Pura20Vida-24x14.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Pura20Vida-36x21.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Pura20Vida-48x28.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Pura Vida&#8217;s website uses design elements that communicate to their target audience: the youth. The simplicity of the website allows users to easily navigate through the web pages and find the products they&#8217;re looking for.</p>



<p>One thing that makes Pura Vida&#8217;s website unique is its integration of Instagram feeds at the bottom. In this section, users can find images of customers wearing Pura Vida&#8217;s products and quickly &#8220;shop the look.&#8221;</p>



<p>The product photography is also great! They also highlight images from social media onto their website to show images of their products.</p>



<p>Right now they also have a contest for a shopping spree, the contest pop-ups to users as they enter the site.</p>



<h2>11. <a href="https://www.ae.com/us/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Eagle</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="600" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/American20Eagle.jpg" alt="American20Eagle" class="wp-image-30239" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/American20Eagle.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/American20Eagle-300x176.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/American20Eagle-768x450.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/American20Eagle-24x14.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/American20Eagle-36x21.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/American20Eagle-48x28.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>American Eagle&#8217;s website has definitely improved over the last five years as the brand stepped up its visual appearance by using high-quality images.

<p>Your website is the virtual face of your business.</p>



<p>Whether it’s a freelance portfolio or a million-dollar eCommerce store, your website design and functionality is an indispensable element in generating revenue.</p>



<p>In this increasingly digitally-dependent world, how your website looks will determine if people should trust you and do business with you. It’s do or die for your ROI.</p>



<p>Web technology falls into the ever-changing sphere. Unless you keep up, your website can go down and out before you know it.</p>



<p>This guide will tell you <a href="/blog/how-to-know-its-time-for-a-website-revamp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">if it’s due time for a website revamp</a>.</p>



<p>So if you’re thinking of revamping how your website looks and how it works, should you just go ahead and change things haphazardly?</p>



<p>You see, a website redesign is a tricky process. Unless you do it right, you’ll have to deal with repercussions.</p>



<p>If there’s a right way to do things, there’s also the other side of the coin. So in this post, we’ll talk about 12 of the worst website redesign mistakes you should avoid.</p>



<p>Let’s get right to it.</p>



<h3>Why You Need to Avoid Website Redesign Mistakes</h3>



<p>If you don’t do your best to avoid making redesign mistakes, you’ll have to deal with regrettable risks:</p>



<p>Website ranking will go down, fewer and fewer people will see your website when they make queries on search engines</p>



<ul><li>You will lose leads &#8211; your potential clients</li><li>Your marketing efforts will go to waste</li><li>Your brand can get discredited in the industry</li><li>You’ll be giving undue advantage to your competitors</li><li>Your business can close down</li></ul>



<p>Redesigning a website is not as easy as hiring a web designer and telling him how you’d want the website to look. It involves more than that.</p>



<p>Many businesses made mistakes that cost them. But you can avoid them.</p>



<p>Here are the biggest website redesign mistakes you dodge altogether.</p>



<h2>The 12 Worst Website Redesign Mistakes – Avoid At All Costs</h2>



<h3>Not Checking Previous Analytics, Current Web Design, And Feedbacks</h3>



<p>Relying on gut feeling or peer opinions alone is a formula for a website redesign disaster.</p>



<p>While you might already have a new design for your website in mind, checking your previous analytics on your current design will help you answer the question of why you need to revamp your website.</p>



<p>Starting with analysis and feedback will ensure your redesign efforts will go in the right direction, your budget won’t go to waste, and your income goals are met.</p>



<p>Make a list of the outdated features of your website, another list of functional technologies, and elements that are not on your website yet.</p>



<p>You might need to take on a more <a href="https://novumhq.com/cheapest-website-builder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">functional website builder </a>than the one your first used and <a href="https://novumhq.com/contact-management-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">migrate your data</a>.</p>



<p>You should also check which pages have the least visits, how many pages a unique visitor visits and what path he takes, the bounce rates for each page, and other important KPIs.</p>



<p>If you haven’t utilized Google Analytics yet, now is the best time to do it. This free analytics tool will help you know your website&#8217;s weak and strong points and help you track visitor behavior when on your website.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="508" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-1.jpg" alt="Image 1" class="wp-image-30263" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-1.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-1-300x149.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-1-768x381.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-1-24x12.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-1-36x18.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-1-48x24.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>When you have measurable data in place, it’s easier to see what needs to be changed and which pages to prioritize.</p>



<span id="more-29686"></span>



<p>Another thing you can also do is to use a heat map to check which parts of your web pages have the most engagements. This will help you to see what you just changed and what you should retain in your current design.</p>



<p>Lastly, you should also consider feedback. When <a href="https://www.twine.net/find/web-designers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">choosing a web designer</a> to do the revamp, it’ll be helpful to tap a couple of them and ask for an initial analysis of the website and what they plan to change.</p>



<p>This way you get expert feedback and you’ll also get to choose the best person to do the job.</p>



<h3>Not Testing Enough</h3>



<p>Other than checking for analytics, before you can do the actual website redesign, it will be helpful to do the following testing:</p>



<ul><li>Functionality</li><li>Testing third-party integrations</li><li>Setting up 301 redirects</li><li>Cross-browser testing in the computer, tablet, and mobile phone</li><li>Checking for on-page SEO</li><li>Grammar and spelling check</li><li>Load speed check</li></ul>



<p>Testing for these will help you see what already works well so you can continue implementing it on the revamp.</p>



<p>But the testing doesn’t stop there. The same test still has to be done right before and after the launch.</p>



<p>This extensive testing process will ensure lapses will be taken care off so no blunders will arise and is bug-free once the website is fully operational.</p>



<p>Additionally, you’ll be avoiding the risk of applying the same outdated logic and structure from your previous design. Many testers this has been a common blunder for revamping websites.</p>



<h3>Not Setting Scalable Goals</h3>



<p>After gathering analytics insights and doing some testing, now you have the data needed to see why your website needs a redesign by identifying loopholes and what you should change in it.</p>



<p>Once you have the data, you’ll clearly see what problems you’ll be solving, challenges that need to be addressed, resources you’ll be needing, and what comprises a successful website redesign.</p>



<p>For example, if you’re an eCommerce site like <a href="https://mannequinmall.com/collections/best-sellers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mannequin Mall</a> and 3Wishes (a <a href="https://www.3wishes.com" rel="noopener">costume</a> store), a problem you can see during analysis and testing is a huge drop from the add-to-cart page to the purchase page.</p>



<p>Seeing this, you can then set a goal to see fewer abandoned carts and more conversions.</p>



<p>Or if you have a review website like <a href="https://www.medicalalertbuyersguide.org/best-medical-alert-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medical Alert Buyers Guide</a>, you found out from analysis that website visitors have a huge problem with navigation. You then set a goal of making the navigation easier by reducing the visual clutter on each page.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="360" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-2.jpg" alt="Image 2" class="wp-image-30264" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-2.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-2-300x105.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-2-768x270.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-2-24x8.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-2-36x13.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-2-48x17.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Setting goals will set the right perspective for your redesign project. This way, you can also easily determine if the redesign project was a success.</p>



<p>Otherwise, you’ll have a hard time handling manpower, redesign budget, and also choosing vital integrations.</p>



<p>Without a goal in mind, it’ll be easy for you to change plans at the very last hour, wasting resources and time spent working on the project.</p>



<h3>Prioritizing Aesthetics Over Functionality</h3>



<p>A website redesign isn’t done just to make your website look better to make it more appealing. There’s no point being appealing if visitors get a bad user experience and bounce right off the site never to return again.</p>



<p>You can’t generate sales and get the ROI for your redesign investment this way.</p>



<p>My point?</p>



<p>Functionality should be the utmost priority, visual appeal only second to it.</p>



<p>Make sure that the revamp website doesn’t just look good, more importantly, it has to work better.</p>



<p>Navigation should be easy and unnecessary pages should be removed or merged into another page as supplementary content.</p>



<p>Otherwise, you’ll be <a href="/blog/website-navigation-conversion-rate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hurting your website’s conversion rate</a>.</p>



<h3>Indecisive On What Technology Or Integrations To Use</h3>



<p>What does your website need? Are you a <a href="https://goaura.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SaaS business for Amazon sellers</a> like Aura that needs to offer exceptional customer support? You will need a live chat feature.</p>



<p>Do you offer an <a href="https://www.gilisports.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">innovative product for a classic hobby like Gili Sports</a> does? You’ll need to integrate a review page to prove your product’s quality and credibility.</p>



<p>Do you own a personalized product website like <a href="https://mixam.com/booklets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mixam</a>? You’ll need integrations that’ll make it easy for customers to convey their references.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="650" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-3.jpg" alt="Image 3" class="wp-image-30265" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-3.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-3-300x190.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-3-768x488.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-3-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-3-36x23.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-3-48x30.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Know what integrations help lessen the friction to the conversion path. This way you won’t be swayed to purchase technology that only seems like a fancy addition but has no significant contribution to your website.</p>



<p>Additionally, doing extra research on the latest version of an integration will give you considerable time before needing another website redesign, in turn saving funds.</p>



<p>If you need help, here’s a free worksheet to <a href="/blog/website-redesign" target="_blank" rel="noopener">know what you’ll need for a website revamp</a>. If you’re using WordPress, here’s a more <a href="https://vtldesign.com/what-we-do/web-strategy/wordpress-website-design-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">specified guide on website design</a> on what you need to work on.</p>



<h3>Not Calculating And Setting An Overall Budget</h3>



<p>The “crossing the bridge when you get there” attitude in this aspect of the website redesign process will only get you so far. Chances are, you’ll be exhausting your funds to the last drop and still don’t have a finished website revamp.</p>



<p>If it has been years since your website first went live, chances are the budget you set for it won’t be enough for the revamp.</p>



<p>Web designers fees went up, more advanced features are needed, and some additional plugins need to be bought for added functionality.</p>



<p>That’s why in the previous point, it mentioned that you have to determine which technology and integrations to use because it’s a big part of setting a budget.</p>



<p>Also, setting a timeframe for the project will help set the budget. Without a timeframe, the website redesign process can take longer than expected which means exhausting more funds for the resources needed.</p>



<h3>Making The Web Design Complicated</h3>



<p>When planning a website redesign, a balance must be set. Integrations are great for user experience, but going overboard can hurt the experience.</p>



<p>The latest trend in web design? Simplicity.</p>



<p>I don’t mean making the pages look dull, just not having too much visual clutter that distracts the user from the parts where you need their attention most.</p>



<p>If the web design has too many elements going on, it can be too overwhelming and distracting. Visitors will likely hit the back button the second they see how the website looks.</p>



<p>So avoid putting too much information on the front page, especially above the fold. You only have a second or so to convince visitors that your website is worth exploring.</p>



<p>A great example of this is the current redesign made by <a href="https://everytale.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everytale, a video streaming platform</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="629" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-4.jpg" alt="Image 4" class="wp-image-30266" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-4.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-4-300x184.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-4-768x472.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-4-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-4-36x22.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-4-48x29.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The above-the-fold portion of the homepage is simple yet very captivating with its video and enticing copy.</p>



<p>Keep them captivated by keeping things simple but enticing. If they don’t see too much information the first time they set foot on the website, they’ll be more motivated to scroll down and check what you have to offer.</p>



<p>To make things easier on the eyes, categorize elements on the website, if you have tons of blogs, divide them into categories.</p>



<p>A great example to look at for this is <a href="https://keywestaloe.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Key West Aloe</a>, a skin care online store. Because of the number of products they have, they made it easier for visitors by categorizing it into 3.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="509" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-5.jpg" alt="Image 5" class="wp-image-30267" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-5.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-5-300x149.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-5-768x382.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-5-24x12.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-5-36x18.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-5-48x24.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>If you have lots of contact information, you can either add dividers or make the spaces in between information big enough to make visual segments easily perceptible.</p>



<h3>Unreasonably Rushing The Project</h3>



<p>If this is going to be your first website redesign, chances are you’ll have to do a major overhaul of the website.</p>



<p>It will take time to analyze the current design and get feedback, it will take time to plan and implement tests, it will take time to decide which integration should be added, and it will take time to put everything together.</p>



<p>Yes, drag and drop website builders are available but it definitely won’t be an overnight project.</p>



<p>Think about building a house, would you trust the structure enough to live and sleep peacefully in it if it just took a day to build it?</p>



<p>The quality will always be in question in these cases, the same goes true for redesigning a website.</p>



<p>To get a reasonable time frame, consult with a few designers. Tell them what the work involves and how much they think it will take. From their various responses, you can take the average duration.</p>



<p>It might help to divide the redesign into phases and set deadlines for each phase so it’s easier to see the progress.</p>



<p>But again, you have to consult with the web designer so you can set workable deadlines that won’t compromise the output.</p>



<h3>Neglecting SEO</h3>



<p>Creating a website that doesn’t rank well on search engines is like building a store in the middle of nowhere &#8211; you won’t get customers.</p>



<p>According to a report by the Search Engine Journal, around 60-70% of companies lose organic traffic after a website redesign.</p>



<p>Hence, neglecting search engine optimization is one of the biggest mistakes when doing a website redesign. No matter how good your website looks, if people don’t see it in search engines, you’ll be the only one appreciating it.</p>



<p>Because of this, you should always stay on top of the SEO trends. If you’re hands-on with the project, you can take <a href="https://www.reliablesoft.net/seo-certifications-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEO training</a> to have better control of your website visibility.</p>



<p>The work involves:</p>



<ul><li>Submitting a sitemap to major search engines for your redesigned website to be crawled, indexed, and ranked for any related query</li><li>Ensuring old website URLs are redirected to the new ones through 301 redirects. It’s best if you keep the old URLs</li><li>Security is also a search engine ranking factor, make sure to install security measures, an SSL certificate at the least to ensure browsing safety for visitors</li></ul>



<p>If you feel that you’re spreading yourself too thin by taking on the responsibility of working on the SEO, you can always hire an <a href="https://avidonmarketinggroup.com/ecommerce-seo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEO agency</a> to do the job for you.</p>



<p>SEO is vital for your landing page, product page, and other content like your blogs. This is why this strategy is something you shouldn’t neglect.</p>



<h3>Overlooking Making A Proper Content Strategy</h3>



<p>A redesigned website is only as good as the content it has.</p>



<p>Fresh content containing keywords with high search volume will drive the very people who you redesigned the website for to your business.</p>



<p>Take a look at how that looks with this blog on the <a href="https://www.timecamp.com/blog/2021/06/best-apps-for-timesheets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best timesheet apps</a> made by TimeCamp.com.</p>



<p>Even before you start planning a website redesign, strong and fresh content must already be entrenched on your website so you have an initial list of leads to improve for.</p>



<p>Without them, you won’t have an initial set of testers to check if your revamped website is functional enough to drive more leads and conversions.</p>



<h3>Not Optimizing For Lead Generation</h3>



<p>Driving visitors to your website will be of little use if you can’t convert them to leads.</p>



<p>Your website has to act as a catch basin for people you can potentially sell your items to. You can only move them further in the buyer’s journey if you have lead generation mechanisms in place.</p>



<p>First off, you have to show your brand’s credibility. With that initial trust barrier broken through, you&#8217;ll have more chances of converting casual visitors to buying customers.</p>



<p>Think about this:</p>



<p>If you create a strong content strategy but don’t complement it with lead generation tools, you’re like releasing an arrow but not aiming at the target.</p>



<p>So how can you aim your arrows at the target? Here’s how:</p>



<ul><li>Define your target audience</li><li>Create short educational articles that’ll be helpful for that target audience to position yourself as a thought leader in the industry</li><li>Create a lead magnet to collect the name, email address, and phone numbers of website visitors, when they realize you’re a credible source, they’ll want to learn more from you</li><li>Create an email marketing sequence that’ll build up your credibility further and answer questions regarding your product that stops them from converting</li><li>Schedule calls on those who provided their phone number so you directly ask them for their concerns, assist them, or motivate them further to finally convert. Having a <a href="https://close.com/crm/predictive-dialer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predictive dialer</a> will make things easier for you, it’s another integration you can consider</li><li>Once they convert, continue to nurture leads by providing valuable content for recurring revenue</li></ul>



<p>There are a few ways of offering a lead magnet, some insert it in a blog post while others are more direct by offering it on the homepage.</p>



<p>This is what GrowthRocks, a <a href="https://growthrocks.com/blog/growth-hacking-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">growth hacking</a> service did, and it’s an effective strategy because unlike most that offer PDF guides, they offer a free website health check in exchange for your email address.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="610" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-6.jpg" alt="Image 6" class="wp-image-30268" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-6.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-6-300x179.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-6-768x458.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-6-24x14.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-6-36x21.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-6-48x29.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>But some people prefer getting direct answers from your team. So create a “Contact Us” page so they can get in touch with you in their preferred channel.</p>



<p>Having a live chat feature will also be helpful so leads get the information they need instantly. <a href="https://winpure.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Winpure</a> does this outstandingly, with their live chat feature, they assure a reply within a few minutes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="605" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-7.jpg" alt="Image 7" class="wp-image-30269" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-7.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-7-300x177.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-7-768x454.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-7-24x14.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-7-36x21.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image-7-48x28.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Lastly, don’t forget to add call-to-action buttons on your landing page, contact page, and blog pages. This is a clear way of telling visitors what action you want them to take.</p>



<h3>Not Designing A Functional, Responsive, Ang Mobile-Optimized Website</h3>



<p>A functional website seamlessly works between different browsers and different operating systems.</p>



<p>You can’t guarantee that a network of people use the same browser and operating system. If one of them recommends your brand to another and your website doesn’t work with the gadget they are using, you’ll be losing potential customers.</p>



<p>This can quickly be fixed by cross-browser testing so that bugs can be removed.</p>



<p>Another thing to keep in mind is responsiveness.</p>



<p>Nobody likes clicking on one button but opening another. Always check if the website is responsive to the commands you give it.</p>



<p>Responsiveness also involves fast load speeds. Ensure that the elements you include on your website, specially images and videos are not too heavy. But also ensure that you choose file sizes that don’t compromise the image and video quality.</p>



<p>Lastly, <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-strategies/app-and-mobile/what-users-want-most-from-mobile-sites-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a> notes that 75% of internet users choose a mobile-friendly site. And for good reason, most people search the internet not using their mobile phone, rather than on tablets and computers.</p>



<p>With this in mind, when redesigning your website, optimize for mobile-friendliness and do continuous checks between different devices to ensure they work well on different mobile systems.</p>



<h3>Conclusion</h3>



<p>Make the most out of a website redesign by avoiding the consequences of redesign mistakes. Keep these 12 things in mind so your efforts in making your website look better to convert better won’t go to waste.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Designing websites for business audiences is a unique challenge. Your B2B website has to keep in mind all the nuances, from longer sales cycles to different modes of persuasions, that selling to business buyers requires.</p>



<p>Get it right, though, and your business can reap the rewards.</p>



<p>In today&#8217;s B2B environment, your website can determine the success or failure of your marketing efforts. It&#8217;s a credibility builder, information hub, and lead conversion machine. That is, as long as you get the design right.</p>



<span id="more-29690"></span>



<h2>What Makes the Best B2B Websites Unique</h2>



<p>Most obviously, B2B websites are special because of their audience. You&#8217;re not selling to consumers, who are randomly browsing your Amazon store.<br>Instead, you&#8217;re selling to business customers, often buying teams, who are performing extensive research pulling the trigger.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why B2B businesses typically have longer sales cycles. It&#8217;s also why the website becomes such an important piece of generating qualified leads for further follow-ups and nurturing.</p>



<p>All of that is reflected in the best B2B website designs. They&#8217;re not just engaging, but offer large amounts of relevant information, and natural lead conversion opportunities. All of this is done through the means of your website doing a great job of marketing and positioning themselves as one of the top B2B companies to their target audience.</p>



<h2>How We&#8217;ve Ranked Our Top 15 B2B Sites</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s simple: we went by experience. After all, we have our own <a href="https://huemor.rocks/case-studies/#b2b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">portfolio of B2B website designs</a>, which has given our team plenty of real-life experience in this unique and nuanced field.</p>



<p>Take <a href="https://huemor.rocks/case-studies/extensishr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Extensis HR</a> as an example. In <a href="/blog/website-redesign%C2%A0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redesigning its website</a> for a friendlier approach without losing credibility and streamlining the information flow, Huemor was able to reduce bounce rates by 85% while increasing qualified leads by more than 130%.</p>



<p>That experience has guided our rankings of the top 15 B2B sites below. In fact, each ranking is guided specifically by our team members, who shared their favorite parts and pieces. Let&#8217;s dive in!</p>



<h2>1. <a href="https://www.moo.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moo</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="664" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Moo.jpg" alt="Moo" class="wp-image-30319" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Moo.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Moo-300x195.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Moo-768x498.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Moo-24x16.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Moo-36x23.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Moo-48x31.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>A company that focuses on stationary and business card printing better get its website design right.</p>



<p>Fortunately, that&#8217;s exactly what Moo does.</p>



<p>The homepage design especially sticks out immediately. While clean and straightforward, it still brings out a unique brand personality while subtly showing off just what Moo can do in terms of design.<br>A clean, professional font only helps to convince a business audience of this brand&#8217;s credibility.<br>Including customer reviews is another nice touch that builds instant audience trust. The volume of reviews shared (more than 1,500 at the time of this writing) removes any doubt about the quality of its products.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="765" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Fooda.jpg" alt="Fooda" class="wp-image-30321" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Fooda.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Fooda-300x224.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Fooda-768x574.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Fooda-24x18.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Fooda-36x27.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Fooda-48x36.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Fooda provides a basic need: providing meals to businesses through office lunch services. That type of niche can make for a difficult website to build, as it&#8217;s not easy to explain immediately.</p>



<p>But Fooda&#8217;s website is up to the task. Its homepage illustrations are not just a nice visual, but immediately communicate the service and value proposition. That includes subtly communicating safety assurances by showing Fooda employees masked in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>The same approach carries through the symbols in the homepage navigation, easily distinguishing between the types of clients this company serves. For even more in-depth information, case studies linked straight from the homepage provide in-depth social proof.</p>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t end there, either. Linking recent blog posts at the bottom of the homepage gives readers a natural next step to take to gather more information.</p>



<p>Finally, its <a href="/blog/service-page-design-examples%C2%A0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">service pages</a> are clean, straightforward, and link right to lead generation forms with an option to talk about the details of a potential partnership.</p>

<h2>3. <a href="https://www.targit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Targit</a></h2>

<p>Business intelligence can be a complex and difficult topic to communicate. The term has become a buzzword, making it difficult for the real experts to distinguish themselves.</p>



<p>Enter Targit, a business intelligence suite that&#8217;s not afraid to showcase its expertise.</p>



<p>That starts with the hero image, whose vibrant colors catch the eye and immediately draw in the user. That contrasts nicely with the clean and simple design of the rest of the homepage, whose muted colors make a conscious effort to put information and content first.</p>



<p>Speaking of content: Targit has clearly identified case studies as a central way towards credibility, and it shows through the success stories of current and past clients highlighted prominently on its website.</p>



<p>Finally, we have to talk about the Resource Center. Through guides, webinars, videos, and other media, Targit has built a constant stream of free content any business can leverage. By the time the user finishes browsing through them, the brand almost naturally emerges as a go-to business intelligence partner.</p>



<h2>4. <a href="https://extensishr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Extensis</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="651" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Extensis.jpg" alt="Extensis" class="wp-image-30324" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Extensis.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Extensis-300x191.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Extensis-768x488.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Extensis-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Extensis-36x23.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Extensis-48x31.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>As mentioned in the intro, this brand&#8217;s redesigned website is one of ours. Allow us to explain just why we like it so much.</p>



<p>First, it&#8217;s about approachability. HR can be a relatively dry topic, but animations alongside playful curves and shapes make the brand much more approachable than many of its competitors.</p>



<p>It also adds dimensions, allowing design elements to seemingly pop off the page while browsing.</p>



<p>That concept is perhaps best exemplified through chat bubbles, which pop up across the entire page to highlight user stories, use cases, and more. Clear service categorization based on business size allows for more streamlined decision-making for buyers.</p>



<p>Are we bragging a bit? Maybe. But when you&#8217;re able to take steps like turning your own <a href="/blog/about-us-page-design%C2%A0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">About Us page design best practices</a> into a site that converts significantly more leads, you earn that right.</p>

<h2>5. <a href="https://rocka.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rocka</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="606" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Rocka.jpg" alt="Rocka" class="wp-image-30325" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Rocka.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Rocka-300x178.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Rocka-768x455.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Rocka-24x14.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Rocka-36x21.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Rocka-48x28.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The transition to remote work has received plenty of attention over the past 18 months. Brands like Rocka are able to leverage that attention through their business-focused websites.</p>



<p>Traditional B2B marketers may not think of targeting businesses as bold, but that&#8217;s exactly what this website does. Bold colors, bold fonts, and bold statements all span across the entire screen.</p>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t hurt that the Greek elements throughout the page offer both a subtle contrast to its future-oriented value proposition and a fitting tribute to the movement on the entire site.</p>



<p>Scrolling here is simply a pleasure, subtle animations make the transitions from one section to the next seem seamless, and that look and feel carries through the entire website.</p>



<p>It actually allows the homepage to be more minimalist than initial impressions suggest, trusting that information can be presented more linearly than might be the case with other, less-bold websites.</p>



<h2>6. <a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="532" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Stripe-1.jpg" alt="Stripe 1" class="wp-image-30326" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Stripe-1.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Stripe-1-300x156.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Stripe-1-768x399.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Stripe-1-24x12.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Stripe-1-36x19.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Stripe-1-48x25.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Stripe processes business payments, so its website has to communicate credibility. The fact that its partners, from Amazon to Google, are displayed so prominently on the homepage suggests that the brand knows exactly what it has to accomplish.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s not all, though. Our team was especially impressed by the design of this page for a few reasons.</p>



<p>Start with the subtle vertical lines that aren&#8217;t even noticeable at first, but suggest scrolling down without seeming obtrusive. Once you do, slanted lines, motion graphics and animated icons are sure to catch and keep your attention.</p>



<p>The site also takes an interesting approach to colors. Blues and navy colors remain the focus, but others are brought in as subtle highlights to keep things interesting.</p>



<h2>7. <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grammarly</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="687" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Grammarly.jpg" alt="Grammarly" class="wp-image-30327" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Grammarly.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Grammarly-300x201.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Grammarly-768x515.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Grammarly-24x16.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Grammarly-36x24.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Grammarly-48x32.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Granted, helping websites and writers improve their grammar is not an exciting topic. It does suggest a need to be straightforward and clean, though.</p>



<p>So that&#8217;s exactly what Grammarly does. The design is clean and simple, and the colors match the overall aesthetic and value proposition. Through plenty of whitespace, the website seems open, and each word is given more weight.</p>



<p>And then, of course, there&#8217;s the value proposition. Grammarly is not afraid to show off real grammar edits on its homepage, showing exactly what its services can do for a business through simple animations.</p>



<p>Keeping things simple, the only navigation is in the <a href="/blog/website-footer-design-best-practices" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website&#8217;s footer design</a>, with all other homepage links leading directly to conversion opportunities. Talk about a streamlined experience.</p>



<h2>8. <a href="https://netbasequid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netbase Quid</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="699" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Net-Base-Quid.jpg" alt="Net Base Quid" class="wp-image-30328" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Net-Base-Quid.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Net-Base-Quid-300x205.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Net-Base-Quid-768x524.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Net-Base-Quid-24x16.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Net-Base-Quid-36x25.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Net-Base-Quid-48x33.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Another business intelligence solution, this one takes a more traditional approach than the Targit example above. It&#8217;s similarly effective, though.</p>



<p>From the start, Netbase Quid puts its homepage focus on information. But despite its breadth, the brand avoids crossing the line to information overload by tying the individual sections together nicely.</p>



<p>Well-placed imagery and graphics break up what could be overkill in other cases. One example: each service area is color-coded, directing the user&#8217;s eye towards exactly the thing they&#8217;re looking for.</p>



<p>Finally, Netbase Quid shows off social proof in a dominant, but unobtrusive way. Brand logos like Walmart and the New York Times speak for themselves, while links to further case studies help to convince buying teams to trust this brand with their data.</p>



<h2>9. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dropbox Business</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="626" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Dropbox-Business.jpg" alt="Dropbox Business" class="wp-image-30329" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Dropbox-Business.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Dropbox-Business-300x183.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Dropbox-Business-768x470.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Dropbox-Business-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Dropbox-Business-36x22.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Dropbox-Business-48x29.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s tough to distinguish yourself in the cloud storage space alongside players like Microsoft, Google, and Apple. But Dropbox Business sure makes a strong play for superiority.</p>



<p>First, let&#8217;s talk about the fact that this website starts with pricing information. It doesn&#8217;t pretend to showcase anything else, because in a competitive niche like this, that&#8217;s crucial information to potential buyers. Showcasing plans side-by-side makes for easy comparisons depending on business needs.</p>



<p>Beyond that, the website maintains a clean and professional feel, thanks in large part to a simple color scheme of black and white with a touch of royal blue. There is nothing complicating the experience.<br>Keep scrolling, and you come to a few more unique features. A customer carousel allows you to consume social proof at your own pace, while a FAQ section (not typical for homepages) gets through some of the most important information. Finally, the time-delayed chat feature ensures that no block is left unturned for potential users and business partners.</p>



<h2>10. <a href="https://www.loopreturns.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Loop Returns</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="688" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Loop-Returns-1.jpg" alt="Loop Returns 1" class="wp-image-30330" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Loop-Returns-1.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Loop-Returns-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Loop-Returns-1-768x516.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Loop-Returns-1-24x16.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Loop-Returns-1-36x24.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Loop-Returns-1-48x32.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>It might be the biggest headline of any site we&#8217;ve reviewed, followed by the boldest hero. And yet, Loop Returns makes it work.</p>



<p>Users realize quickly that this company is all about streamlining the returns process for retailers and e-commerce merchants. And they&#8217;ll keep reading while they do, thanks to bold colors, fonts, and animations.</p>



<p>As one of our reviewers put it so aptly, &#8220;the design just jumps in your face.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not just about flashy designs, though. The animations actually contribute to the user experience, while fonts are used intentionally to draw the reader&#8217;s eye to what matters.</p>



<p>Loop Returns realizes that its services may not be obvious to everyone. So the website features a <em>See How it Works</em> page, which shows its service an action and flows naturally through the entire process. Here, design boldness doesn&#8217;t overshadow, but enhances the site&#8217;s functionality.</p>



<h2>11. <a href="https://www.swell.is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swell</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="716" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Swell.jpg" alt="Swell" class="wp-image-30331" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Swell.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Swell-300x210.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Swell-768x537.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Swell-24x17.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Swell-36x25.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Swell-48x34.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>As an e-commerce SaaS platform, Swell competes against the likes of Shopify, Magento, and BigCommerce. Simply put, its website has to stand out for the service to have a shot.</p>



<p>Fortunately, it does. Illustrations are designed with a glorious amount of detail, animated to bring motion and a 3D feel into the site. The use of uncommon design elements in this space, like the color purple as both an accent and subtle background, immediately distinguishes Swell from its competition.</p>



<p>Speaking of which: this brand doesn&#8217;t shy away from its big-name competitors, but compares itself to them right on the homepage.</p>



<p>Beyond the homepage, the Features page stands out. The information presented is short and succinct, with a sidebar menu allowing users to find exactly what they&#8217;re looking for within seconds.</p>



<h2>12. <a href="https://nektar.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nektar</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="734" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Nektar.jpg" alt="Nektar" class="wp-image-30332" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Nektar.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Nektar-300x215.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Nektar-768x551.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Nektar-24x17.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Nektar-36x26.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Nektar-48x34.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>As far as B2B data and business intelligence platforms go, Nektar is not necessarily innovative. That doesn&#8217;t make it less appealing, though.</p>



<p>A clean and simple design keeps the focus on the most important pieces of content. Meanwhile, the color palette frames the information intentionally without being intrusive or boring.</p>



<p>Beyond the color, intentionally designed sections split the information into easily digestible chunks. Tasteful illustrations show what the actual platform looks like on mobile phones and desktops.</p>



<p>But the showstopper of the site is its animation. The hero image, with dots moving through lines in a way that looks almost like an electrical grid, shows exactly what the service offers. Scroll down, and tasteful animations, intentionally kept in the background, add a degree of dynamism that keeps visitors from getting bored or distracted.</p>



<h2>13. <a href="https://evernote.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Evernote</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="568" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Evernote.jpg" alt="Evernote" class="wp-image-30333" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Evernote.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Evernote-300x166.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Evernote-768x426.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Evernote-24x13.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Evernote-36x20.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Evernote-48x27.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The popular note taking app has both personal and more comprehensive business benefits. Its website reflects that exact audience and benefit split, with an equal focus but clean separation between both sides of the coin. It even carries through its pricing plans, displayed prominently on the website.</p>



<p>Every user of Evernote immediately recognizes its shade of green, so it&#8217;s no surprise that the same green is used effectively as an accent color throughout the site. It adds a pop that keeps the clean design from getting boring.</p>



<p>Evernote truly shines in its organization and functionality, though.</p>



<p>The navigation makes finding information easy and straightforward, a perfect match with its value proposition of simplifying note taking. Finally, actionable visuals of desktop and mobile interfaces show the user exactly what they can expect once they sign up.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="710" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Atlassian.jpg" alt="Atlassian" class="wp-image-30334" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Atlassian.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Atlassian-300x208.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Atlassian-768x533.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Atlassian-24x17.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Atlassian-36x25.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Atlassian-48x33.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>That hero image is nothing if not unique. It also communicates immediate personality, which is a feat for a large company responsible for software like Jira and Trello.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a lot of content on this B2B website. The good news is that it never quite feels like a lot. A well organized footer and top-page navigation, along with tabbed lists of solutions and plenty of links to more information in relevant spots, always let the user know exactly where to go.</p>



<p>Atlassian&#8217;s brand blue is used intentionally. Throughout the homepage, it highlights key text and links, streamlining the user experience. Meanwhile, each image is functional, showcasing exactly what the company can provide for businesses.</p>



<h2>15. <a href="https://iohk.io/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Input Output HK</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="654" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Iohk.jpg" alt="Iohk" class="wp-image-30335" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Iohk.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Iohk-300x192.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Iohk-768x491.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Iohk-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Iohk-36x23.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Iohk-48x31.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Now here&#8217;s a unique experience. More a portfolio than a traditional B2B website, IOHK looks to impress with its visuals. That starts with a seemingly empty black homepage, lit up by the colorful trail the cursor leaves.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s undoubtedly fun to play with, but also has a surprising calming effect that shows off what the company can do. Beyond that, it&#8217;s all about a simple, straightforward layout and navigation.<br>The top navigation is the gateway to all the substantial information about IOHK. From there, Technology and Research are simply designed and straightforward, which is especially important given the complexity of the work this brand does.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s all tied together with a footer that gets you to the right information at the right time. The unique visual intro may not seem that way, but this is actually one of the easiest websites to understand and navigate we&#8217;ve come across.</p>



<h2>Wrapping it Up</h2>



<p>These top examples make it clear: there is no blueprint to the best B2B websites. Instead, there are multiple pathways to achieve core business goals, from generating brand awareness to leads and competitive advantages.</p>



<p>Of course, these are just a few of the countless examples out there. We&#8217;ve shared our favorites; what are yours? Have you found any websites that B2B marketers just have to know about? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.</p>

<p>Beauty might be in the eye of the beholder. Of course, the same is not true when talking about best beauty website design.</p>



<p>Here, beauty brands have to follow a few central design best practices. The competition in the beauty space, especially when it comes to beauty ecommerce websites, is fierce. Standing out is crucial to make sure they attract, convince, and <a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/website-navigation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">convert</a> their audience.</p>



<p>The general purpose of all of these beauty websites is simple: attract your audience&#8217;s eye, then guide them to the <a href="/blog/how-to-build-the-perfect-product-page" target="_blank" rel="noopener">product page</a> to make sure they convert. To get there, anything from the <a href="/blog/top-homepage-design-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homepage</a> to the <a href="/blog/about-us-page-design%C2%A0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about us page</a> and even the <a href="/blog/website-footer-design-best-practices%C2%A0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">footer</a> has to work perfectly in concert.</p>



<p>Fortunately, you&#8217;re not on your own.</p>



<p>In the past few years, we&#8217;ve helped brands like <a href="https://huemor.rocks/case-studies/gleamin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gleamin</a>, <a href="https://huemor.rocks/case-studies/alodia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alodia Haircare</a>, <a href="https://huemor.rocks/case-studies/briogeo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Briogeo</a>, and <a href="https://huemor.rocks/case-studies/coverfx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CoverFX</a> make a name for themselves online. Now, we&#8217;re bringing that expertise to you.</p>



<p>The below beauty website examples are handpicked by our team for a variety of reasons. They stand out for reasons that range from colors to navigation. Together, they serve as an inspiration for any beauty brands&#8217; ecommerce website to begin standing out.</p>



<span id="more-29692"></span>



<h2>1. <a href="https://www.glossier.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glossier</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="518" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Glossier.jpg" alt="Glossier" class="wp-image-30338" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Glossier.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Glossier-300x152.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Glossier-768x389.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Glossier-24x12.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Glossier-36x18.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Glossier-48x24.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>At first glance, Glossier&#8217;s website is simple, aesthetically pleasing, and easy to navigate. Large images showcase the product on its own and on a model, while pink colors perfectly match the brand. A clean, natural look is a perfect match for this industry.</p>



<p>With Glossier, navigation is not reduced to the main menu. Holding your cursor over a category brings up the top options within that category, previewing exactly what the user is looking for. Bundling products makes for a more straightforward online shopping experience.</p>



<p>In short, simplicity is key. The fact that the branding is consistent and strong throughout only helps to make this a site that fully leans into its brand and maximizes its potential.</p>



<h2>2. <a href="https://www.aveneusa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avene</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="554" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Avene.jpg" alt="Avene" class="wp-image-30339" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Avene.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Avene-300x162.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Avene-768x416.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Avene-24x13.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Avene-36x19.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Avene-48x26.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>This skincare site leans fully into its brand. It wins by approaching the online experience from the user&#8217;s perspective, allowing for shopping experiences based on skin concern and even a naturally flowing skincare regimen quiz.</p>



<p>Of course, advanced users can still opt for a more traditional online shopping experience to find their preferred skin care category or product collection.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve emphasized the <a href="/blog/category-page-design%C2%A0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">importance of category pages</a> in the past, and Avene fully leans into them. Every product shows a list of benefits, available on-demand through a drop-down menu. And if you&#8217;re not quite ready to shop yet, the site&#8217;s &#8220;Skintelligence&#8221; blog is ready to educate you and provide add-on value while showcasing their expertise in the skin care industry.</p>



<h2>3. <a href="https://www.100percentpure.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100% Pure</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="600" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/100-Pure.jpg" alt="100 Pure" class="wp-image-30340" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/100-Pure.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/100-Pure-300x176.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/100-Pure-768x450.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/100-Pure-24x14.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/100-Pure-36x21.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/100-Pure-48x28.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Talk about a top beauty site that shines through aesthetics.</p>



<p>The appearance is as the brand name suggests: bright colors, but without being too flashy, catch the eye without being annoying. Meanwhile, menus with background pictures of the actual products add a fun touch to the navigation without compromising readability.</p>



<p>The shopping experience is still front and center here. An under $25 section appeals to budget shoppers, while a chat feature helps with anything from making a decision to potential check-out issues.</p>



<p>Once you get to the product pages, you find in-depth videos and information on how to apply the product, keeping the focus on education. But 100% Pure is not afraid to lean into its brand, either; a philanthropy site helps to communicate that when you shop here, you help to make a difference.</p>



<h2>4. <a href="https://www.winkylux.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Winky Lux</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="600" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Winky-Lux.jpg" alt="Winky Lux" class="wp-image-30341" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Winky-Lux.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Winky-Lux-300x176.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Winky-Lux-768x450.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Winky-Lux-24x14.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Winky-Lux-36x21.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Winky-Lux-48x28.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Now here&#8217;s a homepage to be proud of. It follows a bunch of our <a href="/blog/ecommerce-homepage-design%C2%A0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ecommerce homepage best practice</a>s, from a rotating and engaging hero image all the way down to the bright colors and navigational ease through category pages featured right on the home screen.</p>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t stop there, of course. Throughout the site, subtle animations are just enough to keep audience interest without becoming distracted. They make sure that the products pop and always stay that center of the experience.</p>



<p>Winky Lux shines in its shopping experience, too. The checkout page design (again following our <a href="/blog/checkout-page-design%C2%A0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best practices</a>) is clean and straightforward. Before you get there, it&#8217;s easy to add items to a wishlist before making a buying decision, and even seeing what products pair well with others on the individual product pages.</p>



<div class="huemorProtip-container" style="background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><h2 class="huemorProtip-title" style="color:black">Protip</h2><p style="color:black" class="huemorProtip-description">The best Beauty websites have beautifully branded homepages, much like the one for Winky Lux! They are organized with a clean design making find key information a breeze. Check out our article for more tips on how you can create an amazing <a href="/blog/ecommerce-homepage-design" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ecommerce homepage</a>.</p><div class="huemorProtip-button"></div></div>



<h2>5. <a href="https://www.rarebeauty.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rare Beauty</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="600" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Rare-Beauty.jpg" alt="Rare Beauty" class="wp-image-30342" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Rare-Beauty.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Rare-Beauty-300x176.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Rare-Beauty-768x450.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Rare-Beauty-24x14.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Rare-Beauty-36x21.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Rare-Beauty-48x28.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>One of the main drawbacks of shopping for beauty products online is not being able to see what they look like on your skin through a website. Rare Beauty circumvents that, through an innovative shade finder tool and filters from finish to coverage that are indispensable in finding the right product for each person.</p>



<p>These tools integrate naturally within the larger site, which is clean and almost feels delicate — a perfect match for a beauty brand. Featuring customers who have tagged the brand on social media is a great touch to bring in peer recognition, showing the product in action and in the real world.</p>



<p>Like others mentioned in this list, Rare Beauty is not afraid to show off its societal causes. A mental health blog on the site connects directly to the fact that a percentage of each sale supports the same cause, staking a claim beyond just technical product quality.</p>



<h2>6. <a href="https://theordinary.deciem.com/us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Ordinary</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="493" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/The-Ordinary.jpg" alt="The Ordinary" class="wp-image-30343" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/The-Ordinary.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/The-Ordinary-300x144.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/The-Ordinary-768x370.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/The-Ordinary-24x12.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/The-Ordinary-36x17.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/The-Ordinary-48x23.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Where most beauty brands go classic, The Ordinary leans into the modern. A sleek, simple color scheme connects perfectly with an innovative use of shapes and angles to make for a unique experience in this space.</p>



<p>The hero image rotates through, but the ability to hit pause to learn more about a product featured at any time is a plus. So is the plus button that allows you to jump straight from hero to a product page.</p>



<p>Not sure what you&#8217;re looking for yet? The Regimen Builder can help you build your own skin care routine from the ground up. On the individual product pages, meanwhile, a technology section teaches users about each product, ingredients, and how they interact with your skin.</p>



<h2>7. <a href="https://y-ourskin.com/?h=home%C2%A0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Your Skin</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="510" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Your-Skin.jpg" alt="Your Skin" class="wp-image-30344" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Your-Skin.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Your-Skin-300x149.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Your-Skin-768x383.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Your-Skin-24x12.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Your-Skin-36x18.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Your-Skin-48x24.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>As soon as you get to the homepage, you notice something unique. The color scheme here is not bright or even modern, but subdued and natural. What might not work in other industries is perfect here, for its natural implications and the uniqueness compared to other skincare brands.</p>



<p>We also love the navigational cues on this page. Arrows lead you exactly where you need to go, never leaving you feeling confused or lost. Frequently featured customer reviews and quotes, from the homepage to category and product pages, leave no doubt on whether you should convert.</p>



<p>For a brand called Your Skin, it should not come as a surprise that the skin quiz is highlighted prominently throughout the website. The trick here, of course, is that it never feels obtrusive or annoying.</p>



<h2>8. <a href="https://wholydose.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wholy Dose</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="583" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Wholy-Dose.jpg" alt="Wholy Dose" class="wp-image-30345" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Wholy-Dose.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Wholy-Dose-300x171.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Wholy-Dose-768x437.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Wholy-Dose-24x14.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Wholy-Dose-36x20.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Wholy-Dose-48x27.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The use of shading on the homepage&#8217;s hero image is in a class of its own. It also foreshadows the entire site, which uses simple lines and grey tones to convey a feeling of being clean and straightforward.</p>



<p>Wholy Dose is not afraid to stand behind expert recommendations on its homepage, which gives it an instant feel of credibility. Meanwhile, a band of the brand&#8217;s Instagram posts brings in the social engagement piece, connecting on the peer level with the audience as well.</p>



<p>Looking for unique features? The product page includes recipe ideas that match perfectly with each product. The company&#8217;s blog, meanwhile, features plenty of categories to read about, set up in a clean and brand-consistent way to streamline the user experience.</p>



<h2>9. <a href="https://plenaire.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plenaire</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="565" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Plenaire.jpg" alt="Plenaire" class="wp-image-30346" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Plenaire.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Plenaire-300x166.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Plenaire-768x424.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Plenaire-24x13.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Plenaire-36x20.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Plenaire-48x26.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Scroll down the homepage, and you&#8217;ll come across something far more natural than most websites: imagery that seems to be arranged randomly, without fitting into any particular grid.</p>



<p>That, plus a light purple and blue color scheme, provides it a feeling of openness that few other beauty sites can offer. It also flows through to its skincare category page, where words like clean, energize, and relax float seemingly randomly across the page to help make the point.</p>



<p>Beyond that, subtlety is the name of the game for Plenaire. The buttons are simple, the homepage animation is barely there but still draws the eye. The lines are clean, and the font is minimalist. In other words, the full focus is on the product at all times.</p>



<h2>10. <a href="https://www.carbonbeauty.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carbon Beauty</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="573" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Carbon-Beauty.jpg" alt="Carbon Beauty" class="wp-image-30347" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Carbon-Beauty.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Carbon-Beauty-300x168.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Carbon-Beauty-768x430.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Carbon-Beauty-24x13.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Carbon-Beauty-36x20.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Carbon-Beauty-48x27.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Beauty websites tend to be complex, so scrolling is inevitable. Carbon Beauty shows how to take advantage of that fact.</p>



<p>It starts with a dynamic and bold hero image. From there, the scroll experience here is nothing but positive. Large, bold text moves along with the images, creating a dynamic effect that builds interest and excitement. Even getting to the bottom works well, with a footer that catches the eye and allows for newsletter subscriptions without having to leave the page.</p>



<p>The combination of excitement and simplicity extends beyond the homepage. Everything has movement to it, including category pages that change in design depending on mouse hovers.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="505" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Garoa-Skincare.jpg" alt="Garoa Skincare" class="wp-image-30348" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Garoa-Skincare.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Garoa-Skincare-300x148.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Garoa-Skincare-768x379.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Garoa-Skincare-24x12.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Garoa-Skincare-36x18.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Garoa-Skincare-48x24.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>As with the prior two beauty website examples, Garoa has paid special attention to its animations and scrolling experience. Beginning on the homepage, it&#8217;s more than just vertical movement, with horizontal elements entering the picture and dynamic text interacting with images.</p>



<p>That experience, as with Carbon Beauty, moves through their category pages as well, building a feeling of consistency. All of it fits within an earthy and authentic color scheme that matches the brand exceptionally well.</p>



<p>Garoa&#8217;s value proposition focuses on skin care for every season, and its website is sure to highlight that fact. The brand effectively brings in a secondary educational component by mentioning that all ingredients come from Brazil, and the benefits of that process.</p>



<h2>12. <a href="https://hetime.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hetime</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="525" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Hetime.webp" alt="Hetime" class="wp-image-30349" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Hetime.webp 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Hetime-300x154.webp 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Hetime-768x394.webp 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Hetime-24x12.webp 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Hetime-36x18.webp 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Hetime-48x25.webp 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Hetime is a simple, two-product brand with a unique angle: skin care for men. Its branding clearly reflects that fact, with a dynamic aesthetic and photography designed to stand out immediately.<br>At the beginning of the homepage, the hero image blends directly into the rest of the content through curved, wavy lines that naturally directs audience attention to the more detailed information. Both products are featured in detail on the homepage, a natural fit for a simple company without complex categories.</p>



<p>For all the details, the product page sets up similar category leaders in other industries, like Apple. Both products are shown side-by-side, showcasing their similarities and differences. It&#8217;s a mix of simplicity and functionality that other brands will do well to emulate.</p>

<h2>13. <a href="https://www.frankbody.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frank Body</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="545" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Frank-Body.jpg" alt="Frank Body" class="wp-image-30350" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Frank-Body.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Frank-Body-300x160.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Frank-Body-768x409.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Frank-Body-24x13.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Frank-Body-36x19.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Frank-Body-48x26.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>&#8220;Hey babe, I&#8217;m Frank Body.&#8221; The page title of the homepage previews just what makes this website so unique and engaging. Playful copy, from the hero all the way to the theme of the rewards page and the word bubbles for individual featured products, immediately establishes the feel this brand is going for.</p>



<p>That feel carries through to the aesthetic in all shapes and sizes. The fonts stand out from all other beauty sites we&#8217;ve examined, and the color scheme makes every piece of the site welcoming and engaging.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s not to say that the educational component pulls up short, though. Category page graphics highlight core benefits of each option without using too many words. Meanwhile, linking to the brand&#8217;s YouTube account in relevant spots allows Frank Body to show more product details without crowding up limited website space.</p>



<h2>14. <a href="https://lovekinship.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kinship</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="536" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Kinship.jpg" alt="Kinship" class="wp-image-30351" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Kinship.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Kinship-300x157.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Kinship-768x402.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Kinship-24x13.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Kinship-36x19.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Kinship-48x25.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>At first glance, it doesn&#8217;t feel like any other beauty site. The personality, youthful feel, and glowy vibe of the images makes Kinship stand out immediately, with a font and tan background that blend in naturally and take full advantage of the brand&#8217;s visual palette.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s not to say that user experience takes a backseat. It still includes everything an e-commerce site requires.</p>



<p>The homepage allows for easy swiping of products in a visual, engaging way. Meanwhile, strategic design elements, like a moving collage of the brand&#8217;s Instagram posts, highlights product benefits while encouraging cross-channel user experiences.</p>



<h2>15. <a href="https://usehuron.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Huron</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="536" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Huron.jpg" alt="Huron" class="wp-image-30352" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Huron.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Huron-300x157.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Huron-768x402.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Huron-24x13.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Huron-36x19.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Huron-48x25.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Much like Hetime, Huron&#8217;s audience makes this website inherently different. A beauty product directed towards men, its website feels masculine without exaggerating the process or turning it into a cliche.</p>



<p>Part of Huron&#8217;s value proposition is that its product is made in the USA. But rather than throwing that fact into the audience&#8217;s face, it communicates the fact more subtly through its red, white, and blue colors.</p>



<p>In all, it&#8217;s a clean experience matched perfectly to its audience and the look of its products. Slightly offset background squares make the images and the product they feature pop, while showing the savings of buying more than one product is a natural and non-intrusive upsell opportunity.</p>



<h2>16. <a href="https://kinfield.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kinfield</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="535" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Kinfield.jpg" alt="Kinfield" class="wp-image-30353" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Kinfield.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Kinfield-300x157.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Kinfield-768x401.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Kinfield-24x13.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Kinfield-36x19.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Kinfield-48x25.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Here&#8217;s a brand that commits to its look. The squiggly line that&#8217;s so prominent on its products shines through on the website as well, incorporated into all layout as both an interesting design element and a cue to continue scrolling.</p>



<p>Even headings and words start taking the same shape, while the photography adds to the fun and natural look through a great balance of lifestyle and featured products.</p>



<p>Finally, the footer (distinguished by the same squiggly shape, of course) is both personal and direct. It feels like a part of each page it&#8217;s on, despite containing all the typical footer information required. That sort of continuity maximizes the chances of audiences paying attention.</p>



<h2>17. <a href="https://gleamin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gleamin</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="545" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Gleamin-2.webp" alt="Gleamin 2" class="wp-image-30363" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Gleamin-2.webp 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Gleamin-2-300x160.webp 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Gleamin-2-768x409.webp 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Gleamin-2-24x13.webp 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Gleamin-2-36x19.webp 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Gleamin-2-48x26.webp 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In the beauty industry, online and product experience are closely connected in the audience&#8217;s eye. Gleamin takes advantage of that fact, with a bright yellow clearly tying website and products together. It matches beautifully with the bold blank homepage font on top of the yellow, exuding confidence and boldness.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s not to say that user experience takes a back seat. A before and after category page allows users to recognize their problems in the experience of others, finding the right product solutions. Throughout the homepage and website, real customers using the product while reviewing it adds authenticity and credibility.</p>



<p>This website sells a single product, and it doesn&#8217;t try to overcomplicate things. That simplicity keeps the focus on what matters most, creating a streamlined, straightforward experience.</p>



<div class="huemorProtip-container" style="background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><h2 class="huemorProtip-title" style="color:black">Protip</h2><p style="color:black" class="huemorProtip-description">Shameless plug! Check out our case study on how we helped Gleamin create an amazing <a href="/gleamin-case-study" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a>.</p><div class="huemorProtip-button"></div></div>



<h2>18. <a href="https://besamecosmetics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bésame Cosmetics</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="525" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Besame.jpg" alt="Besame" class="wp-image-30354" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Besame.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Besame-300x154.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Besame-768x394.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Besame-24x12.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Besame-36x18.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Besame-48x25.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Where many beauty websites go modern, Bésame Cosmetics one goes vintage. Starting with the homepage, our reviewers can&#8217;t help but think of old Hollywood glam, and all the elegance that comes with it.</p>



<p>That feeling carries through from the color scheme to the fonts and even the navigation, which is organized like a classic beauty site with categories like lips, eyes, face, and so on. It&#8217;s nothing if not straightforward.</p>



<p>That classic elegance, of course, doesn&#8217;t prevent modern features from shining through. The website&#8217;s chat feature is excellent, and so is the educational blog that&#8217;s linked straight from the homepage. The historical focus of featured posts tie it all together as a vintage beauty experience.</p>



<h2>19. <a href="https://www.essie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Essie</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="558" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Essie.jpg" alt="Essie" class="wp-image-30355" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Essie.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Essie-300x163.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Essie-768x419.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Essie-24x13.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Essie-36x20.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Essie-48x26.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Essie</figcaption></figure>



<p>Navigational menus aren&#8217;t typically described as &#8220;fun&#8221;. This one, though, qualifies. Scroll halfway down the homepage, and you&#8217;ll see rounded-off squares that visualize exactly what each category page will look like.</p>



<p>Once you get to the category page, the same style carries through, building consistency in the process.</p>



<p>Our favorite feature, though, is the Virtual Try-On section. Upload your hand&#8217;s image, and you can see exactly what different shades of nail polish would look like with your skin tone. It&#8217;s a unique and engaging way to leverage augmented reality in a way that actually helps make buying decisions.</p>



<h2>20. <a href="https://www.functionofbeauty.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Function of Beauty</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="593" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Function-of-Beauty.jpg" alt="Function of Beauty" class="wp-image-30356" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Function-of-Beauty.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Function-of-Beauty-300x174.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Function-of-Beauty-768x445.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Function-of-Beauty-24x14.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Function-of-Beauty-36x21.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Function-of-Beauty-48x28.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>This website presents almost every color in the rainbow. Somehow, though, it&#8217;s able to do so without appearing tacky or overwhelming. Instead, the variety of colors emphasizes the brand&#8217;s unique value proposition: the customizable feature of its products.</p>



<p>Two more features stand out in this pastel bright and clean website. First is the quiz to take before seeing products, removing irrelevant options from the consideration set and immediately narrowing your options. Streamlining is good!</p>



<p>The second is a clear variation between the brand&#8217;s two product lines, skin care and hair care. Function of Beauty changes fonts when talking about each, introducing subtle differences that keep them separate while still presenting them as part of the same brand.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>The beauty industry is complex, so it stands to reason that the beauty website examples showcased here range widely. Still, each of them offers great inspiration for how to build your own website in a way that attracts, engages, and converts your audience.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Since 2019, software as a service (SaaS) has become one of the fastest-growing market segments in the world. In fact, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/505243/worldwide-software-as-a-service-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Statista reports</a> that the SaaS market is estimated to be worth approximately $123 billion as of 2021 and is expected to reach $145 billion the following year.</p>



<p>It is clear to see that the demand for SaaS providers is increasing. With this growing demand comes a need to ensure that brands put out the best SaaS websites they can to stand out.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re already familiar with what &#8216;SaaS&#8217; is, then feel free to skip right past the next part and jump into the list.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re unsure what this acronym means, then let us take a quick moment to level-set a bit so we&#8217;re all on the same page.</p>



<h3>What is SaaS and what are SaaS websites?</h3>



<p>&#8216;SaaS&#8217; is an acronym that stands for &#8216;Software as a Service&#8217;. Companies will create software that solves unique challenges within a marketplace, and then offer a license to that software for a fee.</p>



<p>SaaS products have transformed how we do business today. They eliminate complexities and allow smaller businesses to maintain more sophisticated operations at lower costs. The era of huge R&amp;D projects to develop proprietary software has been eliminated in many fields because of this.</p>



<p>(Bad for software developers maybe, but good for everyone else <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>A SaaS website is meant to communicate the value of the SaaS company by highlighting its unique product offerings. They also serve as the primary sales driver for most companies.</p>



<p>At Huemor, we have helped dozens of companies develop unique and <a href="https://huemor.rocks/saas-and-technology-websites/" rel="noopener">memorable SaaS websites</a> that provide their customers with best-in-class user experiences. In that time, we&#8217;ve started to see the patterns of what works and what doesn&#8217;t. Below is a collection of our &#8216;short list&#8217; of website examples we often come back to that always seem to inspire.</p>



<p>Alright, so let&#8217;s get to it.</p>



<h2>Our Top 20 SaaS Website Examples &amp; Why They Rock.</h2>



<h4>1. <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Drive</a></h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="626" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Google-Drive.jpg" alt="Google Drive" class="wp-image-30385" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Google-Drive.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Google-Drive-300x183.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Google-Drive-768x470.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Google-Drive-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Google-Drive-36x22.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Google-Drive-48x29.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Google Drive is at the top of this software as a service website examples list, and rightfully so. Not only does it provide a free cloud storage solution, but it is also easily accessible to any user and across multiple devices.</p>



<p>Teams can seamlessly collaborate on tasks, plans, and projects using the full-featured office suite from Google Drive. Finally, its straightforward user interface makes it incredibly user-friendly even for newbies.</p>



<h4>2. <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a></h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="477" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Git-Hub.jpg" alt="Git Hub" class="wp-image-30386" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Git-Hub.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Git-Hub-300x140.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Git-Hub-768x358.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Git-Hub-24x11.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Git-Hub-36x17.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Git-Hub-48x22.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>GitHub is a public code repository that provides a great user experience on both desktop and mobile devices. Users can create their own code, share it with others, and explore other code repositories directly from their browsers.</p>

<p>All of the graphics that they have used on their website help let people know what Crossbeam is all about. Meanwhile, their page on case studies does a great job of highlighting the previous experiences their users had with their service.</p>

The homepage of the site copy answers the basic questions visitors have about the brand while still redirecting them to important pages that could answer their questions in-depth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In an ideal world, your users don&#8217;t even notice your website navigation. They use it to quickly get where they need to go, flowing through your site and to your conversion points in the exact paths you&#8217;ve mapped for them.</p>



<span id="more-29698"></span>



<p>Unfortunately, too often, that ideal world doesn&#8217;t reflect reality. Navigation in web design becomes a sticking point that frustrates your users and hurts your conversions.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s not an uncommon problem, either; even the best web pages have some friction points in their site&#8217;s navigation.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s time to do something about that. According to one study, <a href="https://smallbiztrends.com/2019/01/easy-website-navigation-is-important.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">94% of users</a> believe your website needs to be easy to navigate. If it isn&#8217;t, <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/compelling-stats-website-design-optimization-list" target="_blank" rel="noopener">38% of visitors</a> will stop engaging with your site immediately.</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s before we even begin to talk about the role that your <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/seo-ux-main-navigation/297965/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">navigation plays in your SEO efforts</a>.</p>



<p>In other words, unassuming as it might be, your website&#8217;s navigation could actually be a major pivot point for your conversion rates and SEO efforts. If you don&#8217;t get it right, you risk a significant number of visitors dropping off a different website and failing to convert.<br>The good news: getting it right is not rocket science. You just need some basic knowledge about navigational structures, and how to avoid some of the most common mistakes made in this area. Let&#8217;s get started.</p>

<div class="ChapterFullwidth" style="background-image:url(https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-form">
<a id="chapter 1"></a>
</div><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">Chapter 1</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">5 Common Types of Website Navigation</h2></div></div>



<p>At its most basic, your navigation in web design has a simple purpose: to get your website visitors where they need to go, quickly and without complications or confusion.</p>



<p>Do it right, and you&#8217;ll get them on a path you want them to go. They&#8217;ll quickly get valuable information from your website and perhaps even convert to a lead or customer if they&#8217;re ready for that step.</p>



<p>To get there, most sites use one or more of these 5 types of website navigation:</p>



<h3>1. The Top Menu</h3>



<p>Most readers probably envisioned the top menu immediately upon opening this guide. It&#8217;s the most common navigation menu option out there, a simple horizontal bar listing all the main sections of a web page.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="641" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/top-menu-image.jpg" alt="top menu image" class="wp-image-30413" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/top-menu-image.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/top-menu-image-300x188.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/top-menu-image-768x481.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/top-menu-image-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/top-menu-image-36x23.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/top-menu-image-48x30.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-right">Source &#8211; <a href="https://getneuro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neuro</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Top menus are so popular because they follow the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">F-shaped pattern we use to read web pages</a>. It&#8217;s also often pinned to the top of the website browser window, staying visible even as visitors begin to scroll past the hero image and pop ups.</p>



<p>To get to more than the few sections that fit into the top navigation menu, many websites use drop-downs off the main items, which become categories. Another common option: the sidebar.</p>



<h3>2. The Sidebar</h3>



<p>Some websites have their main navigation on the left side of the page. For most, though, the sidebar is a secondary menu once you&#8217;re already in a specific category.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a bar, usually on the left but sometimes on the right of the page, that presents subcategories to visitors. For content-rich sites that post plenty of site and social media content, it&#8217;s a good way to keep filtering down the search results.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="641" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/side-nav-image.jpg" alt="side nav image" class="wp-image-30414" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/side-nav-image.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/side-nav-image-300x188.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/side-nav-image-768x481.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/side-nav-image-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/side-nav-image-36x23.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/side-nav-image-48x30.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption> Source &#8211; <a href="https://getopenspaces.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Spaces</a> </figcaption></figure>



<p>For example, after clicking on a company&#8217;s blog, you might find topic areas about related content within the blog in the sidebar.</p>



<h3>3. The Footer</h3>



<p>We&#8217;ve recently written about <a href="/blog/website-footer-design-best-practices" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best practices for website footers</a>, which are crucial website navigation options for many users. Information and links here shouldn&#8217;t duplicate what&#8217;s in your main nav, but add to it.</p>



<p>That means reserving it for the type of next steps your users might need once they reach the end of the page. Quick, easy links to conversion-rich pages within the website (and maybe even a secondary call to action) can all find their home in the footer.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="641" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/footer-image.webp" alt="footer image" class="wp-image-30415" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/footer-image.webp 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/footer-image-300x188.webp 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/footer-image-768x481.webp 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/footer-image-24x15.webp 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/footer-image-36x23.webp 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/footer-image-48x30.webp 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption> Source &#8211;<a href="https://www.prima.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Prima</a> </figcaption></figure>



<h3>4. The Breadcrumbs</h3>



<p>These crumbs are not yet another list of links. Instead, they&#8217;re an opportunity to show the path to your target audience used to get to your website.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="537" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/breadcrumbs-image.jpg" alt="breadcrumbs image" class="wp-image-30416" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/breadcrumbs-image.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/breadcrumbs-image-300x157.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/breadcrumbs-image-768x403.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/breadcrumbs-image-24x13.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/breadcrumbs-image-36x19.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/breadcrumbs-image-48x25.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption> Source &#8211; <a href="https://www.aerotech.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aerotech </a>(Check out our <a href="https://huemor.rocks/case-studies/aerotech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">case study</a>) </figcaption></figure>



<p>If your website goes deep into subcategories of subcategories, breadcrumbs become increasingly useful. They allow your audience to stay oriented with where they are, and easily go &#8216;one level up&#8217; again if they need to. It&#8217;s a navigational crutch that has the potential to enhance your user experience.</p>



<h3>5. The Hamburger Menu</h3>



<p>Finally, the rise of mobile-first web design has brought one relatively new type of website navigation into the spotlight: the hamburger menu.</p>



<p>Getting its name from a vague 2D lookalike of a patty between two buns, the hamburger menu started as an option for mobile users for whom a standard navigation would take up the entire web page. Instead, it expands only upon clicking the icon, a kind of navigation-on-demand.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="641" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hamburger-menu.jpg" alt="hamburger menu" class="wp-image-30417" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hamburger-menu.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hamburger-menu-300x188.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hamburger-menu-768x481.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hamburger-menu-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hamburger-menu-36x23.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hamburger-menu-48x30.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption> Source &#8211; <a href="https://globekit.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Globe Kit</a> </figcaption></figure>



<p>However, perhaps to save valuable screen size, hamburger menus are starting to nudge their way into the standard website navigation menu options, as well. Some UX experts are even <a href="https://usabilitygeek.com/making-case-for-desktop-hamburger-menu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">starting to recommend it</a>.</p>



<div class="ChapterFullwidth" style="background-image:url(https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-form">
<a id="chapter 2"></a>
</div><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">Chapter 2</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">7 Common Navigation Issues, and How to Fix Them</h2></div></div>



<p>Now that you&#8217;ve familiarized yourself with the most common types, let&#8217;s jump into the most common problems we tend to encounter in the wild. Don&#8217;t worry, though. We&#8217;ll also provide some best practices in website navigation that can prevent you from making the same (or similar) mistakes.</p>



<h3>Issue #1: Hidden Navigation</h3>



<p>Your website navigation is so crucial to your overall user experience that you can&#8217;t afford to hide it. <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/hamburger-menus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Research has shown</a> that hidden nav items on a site lengthen the time it takes for visitors to search for what they need, increasing frustration in the process.</p>



<p>Hidden navigation comes in more than one way. It might be in an unexpected spot on your website, or blend in too much with your web design. Or, you could hide your individual items behind web design features like a hamburger menu or a &#8220;more&#8221; button.</p>



<p>The intention of saving space might be good, and the look might be great to anyone intimately familiar with the site. But if your navigation is hidden and its individual items aren&#8217;t obvious and easy to find for new visitors, you have a problem.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/564691059?h=6624d39d63&amp;dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="500" height="335" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption> Source &#8211; <a href="https://blab.studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blab.Studio</a> </figcaption></figure>



<h4>How to Fix It: Make it Obvious</h4>



<p>Make sure the nav clearly stands out and is not hidden, and fully represents the options your users have at first glance. Some whitespace, between the navigation and the rest of the site as well as between individual nav items, also doesn&#8217;t hurt.</p>



<h3>Issue #2: Vague Navigation Labels</h3>



<p>It&#8217;s a mistake so widespread, it might as well be common practice. Navigation items are labeled products, videos, services, or something similar. In other words, your labels are how you&#8217;d name your internal folders on a hard drive, if you already knew what was in it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="641" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/vague-navigation.jpg" alt="vague navigation" class="wp-image-30418" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/vague-navigation.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/vague-navigation-300x188.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/vague-navigation-768x481.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/vague-navigation-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/vague-navigation-36x23.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/vague-navigation-48x30.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption> Source &#8211; <a href="https://forgeandsmith.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forge and Smith</a> </figcaption></figure>



<p>The problem is that your users don&#8217;t. They don&#8217;t know what services you offer, or what types of videos you&#8217;re about to show them. They&#8217;ll need to navigate around just to find out—and they won&#8217;t appreciate that extra step.</p>



<h4>How to Fix It: Make Your Labels Descriptive</h4>



<p>Ideally, every item in your navigation should say exactly what it&#8217;s about. Instead of services, list the type of service you offer. Instead of videos, highlight that they&#8217;re DIY tutorials on specific subjects.</p>



<p>As a bonus, search engines also love descriptive labels. You might even want to use keyword research to understand exactly how to label each nav item. That enhances your search engine optimization, Google Analytics, and your user experience, all at once.</p>



<h3>Issue #3: Too Many Options</h3>



<p>Who hasn&#8217;t come to a website and immediately left because the choices were just so overwhelming? It&#8217;s what psychologists describe as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/27/your-money/27shortcuts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paralyzing Problem of Too Many Choices</a>. For your website navigation, it could be an absolute killer.</p>



<p>Two reasons for that. One, too many navigational items, especially if not hierarchically sorted into subcategories, are difficult to browse through. Two, too many choices immediately from your landing page can negatively impact your <a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/page-authority" target="_blank" rel="noopener">page authority</a>.</p>



<p>Most external pages link to your homepage, which Google consequently considers to have maximum authority. That authority is mainly distributed to pages directly linked from your site homepage. The more you link to, the lower the authority of each, lowering your ranking for those pages.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/564771769?h=c90a5238a0&amp;dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="500" height="313" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption> Source &#8211; <a href="https://pittsburghpa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">City of Pittsburgh</a> </figcaption></figure>



<h4>How to Fix It: Keep Your Main Options to 7 or Less</h4>



<p>Seven seems to be a <a href="https://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Miller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">magic number here</a>. Go above, and the negative impact on your visitors confusion and domain authority begins to multiply. In your main menu bar, it&#8217;s crucial not to go above.</p>



<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean sites can only have seven total pages beyond your homepage at least; just not seven &#8216;main pages&#8217; just below your homepage. Beyond that, each should be part of an easily understandable sub-category.</p>



<h3>Issue #4: Random Nav Item Order</h3>



<p>Which items come first, and which come last? You&#8217;d be surprised how random that order can be. Some organizations love to list pricing as a priority, others last. About Us tends to go towards the end, as does a client portfolio. But sometimes, it&#8217;s services.<br>In other words, there isn&#8217;t an established best practice that everyone seems to follow. That doesn&#8217;t mean, of course, that there shouldn&#8217;t be. Once again, paying attention to your users&#8217; expectations can go a long way towards finding a fix.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="857" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/nav-order-image.jpg" alt="nav order image" class="wp-image-30419" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/nav-order-image.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/nav-order-image-300x251.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/nav-order-image-768x643.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/nav-order-image-24x20.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/nav-order-image-36x30.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/nav-order-image-48x40.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4>How to Fix It: The Serial Position Effect</h4>



<p>Another <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/primacy-recency.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">psychology concept</a> for you: when presented with a series of choices, we tend to remember those that came first and last by far the most.</p>



<p>For your site&#8217;s navigation, that means it makes sense that the spots in the middle are actually the least important. Lead your labels with the most important immediate next step (like signing up for a demo or describing your product), before ending with the most important final takeaway (like social proof or pricing).</p>



<h3>Issue #5: Confusing Drop-Down Items</h3>



<p>Drop-downs, in isolation, are often necessary—especially if you have more than seven pages on your website. But they can quickly turn from helpful to awful.</p>



<p>The last thing you want is a vague top-level label, followed by either a drop-down so small that it wasn&#8217;t even necessary, or a huge dropdown of an alphabetized list. It&#8217;s a sure sign to your audience to jump ship.</p>



<p>Search engines also don&#8217;t necessarily like drop-downs because of how difficult they are to crawl. So if you use one, you better get it right.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/564738839?h=f6af9fe382&amp;dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="500" height="313" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption> Source &#8211; <a href="https://www.yale.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yale</a> </figcaption></figure>



<h4>How to Fix It: Structure Your Drop-Downs</h4>



<p>First, take a look and make sure that your page count actually needs a drop-down. A secondary sidebar might actually be more beneficial in your scenario. If you do need one, make sure it&#8217;s structured right, with intuitive categories and no more than five links within each category.</p>



<h3>Issue #6: Navigation/Button Confusion</h3>



<p>Your website has a navigation for users to get around, and call-to-action buttons for them to convert. Some nav bars or footers even have buttons, too. But it can be fatal to confuse the two, or use one as a substitute for the other.</p>



<p>You might be tempted to use the same colors or shapes in both your buttons and your navigation. But that actually confuses your site users and can turn them away from the conversion paths you&#8217;ve built. Websites where the wayfinding and goal seeking are mixed up tend to be a mess to navigate.</p>



<h4>How to Fix It: Create a Clear Design Hierarchy</h4>



<p>It&#8217;s quite simple, actually. Your nav should look one way, and your call-to-action buttons should look another. While they can both fit into a larger branding scheme, their styles should be clearly distinguished in your design hierarchy.</p>



<p>Want to test it out? Place a button directly over your nav bar. Can you still tell that the goal here is separate and different from simple wayfinding? Makes sense, right? If so, your web design hierarchy is working, and your users become much more likely to be confused (and more likely to reach conversion rate optimization).</p>

<h3>Issue #7: Mobile Unfriendliness</h3>



<p>In 2022, everything about your website needs to be optimized for mobile. Unfortunately, too many websites go 90% of the way, but fall short when it comes to their navigation.</p>



<p>The top bar might be hidden in a hamburger menu, with difficult-to-navigate dropdown sub-categories. The footer text might become too small for touch-based operation. And we haven&#8217;t even started talking about the challenges of a secondary navigation (like a sidebar) on a screen too small for it to fit.</p>



<p>So, you get to a system that&#8217;s largely mobile-unfriendly and basically non responsive for mobile. That means potentially alienating almost <a href="https://www.perficient.com/insights/research-hub/mobile-vs-desktop-usage#:~:text=Globally%2C%2068.1%25%20of%20all%20website,of%20visitors%20came%20from%20tablets." target="_blank" rel="noopener">70% of your site visitors</a>. Not a good look, and certainly not good for conversions with your target audience.</p>

<h4>How to Fix It: Test Your Mobile Nav System</h4>



<p>The initial solution here is actually pretty simple: navigate your own website with your own mobile device. That could give you some serious initial insights.</p>



<p>Then, get some credible third parties to review the same thing from their devices, as well. Only be satisfied when the navigation and site design works as well and is as simple on mobile devices as it does on desktop.</p>

<p>When the goal is to be as unassuming and natural as possible, it&#8217;s easy to underestimate just how important website navigation truly is for your users. But it&#8217;s issues like the above that make it clear: if you don&#8217;t get it right, you will lose valuable credibility, attention, and conversions.</p>



<p>The good news is that each of the most common issues also have relatively simple best practice fixes. Take good care of your website, and you&#8217;ll begin to create more interaction, keep your audience&#8217;s attention for longer, and drive more customers effectively towards conversions.</p>
