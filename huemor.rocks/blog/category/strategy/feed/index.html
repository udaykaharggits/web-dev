<p>We talk a lot about how strategy and planning matter.</p>



<p>But what does that actually look like for B2B’s when they’re trying to expand their inbound lead generation efforts?</p>



<p>In this article, I’ll walk you through how to set up lead generation goals that actually align with business goals.</p>



<p>Goals that are clear, well-defined, and achievable for your business.</p>



<p>Ready to dive in?</p>



<div class="huemorProtip-container" style="background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><h2 class="huemorProtip-title" style="color:black">Disclaimer</h2><p style="color:black" class="huemorProtip-description"> For the purposes of this article, we’ll be using simplified figures and a made-up company to demonstrate how all of this works. For your business, this will likely be more complex, but the approach to solving this should be the same.</p><div class="huemorProtip-button"></div></div>



<h2><strong>The Persona</strong></h2>



<p>AlphaX is an enterprise SaaS company focused on helping businesses improve their supply chain woes. This software, coupled with their onboarding fee averages $30,000 per deal in year one, and 90% of their customers stick around for multiple years.</p>



<p>Over the course of 2021, their company experienced a ton of organic growth due to emerging supply chain challenges during the pandemic. Their top-line revenue soared to $20M annually.</p>



<p>This growth, while increasing revenue, have also increased their overhead.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Defining The Goals</strong></h2>



<h3>Business Goal</h3>



<p>Looking forward to 2022, AlphaX’s CEO has set a revenue growth goal of 20% year-over-year to ensure the company remains healthy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s now up to the marketing team to deliver. Where do they start?</p>



<h3><strong>Sales Goal</strong></h3>



<p>As mentioned above, AlphaX’s CEO has set a goal of 20% YoY growth.</p>



<p>That means their new top-line revenue at the end of 2022 should be $24M annually (a total increase of $4,000,000).</p>



<p>With a retention rate of 90% per year and an average of $30k per new deal, that means AlphaX will need to sign 200 new deals in 2022 to make this goal a reality.</p>



<h3><strong>Marketing Goal</strong></h3>



<p>Knowing the target revenue and deals required to get there, it’s now the marketing team&#8217;s job to figure out what this means in terms of their marketing funnel.</p>



<p>After looking at a collective of both their CRM and Analytics tools, they’ve uncovered the following information.</p>



<ul><li>3% of their visitors fill out a demo form.</li><li>85% of those who fill out a demo form book a demo call.</li><li>90% of those who attend a demo call are interested in a proposal.</li><li>40% of proposals submitted turn into paying customers.</li></ul>



<p>With this information in hand, they’re now equipped to figure out based on historical data what their marketing goals should be.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Understanding The Numbers</strong></h4>



<p>The goal is to acquire 200 new customers, so let’s use that to identify each stage of our funnel.</p>



<p>Let’s start by looking at the close rate. 40% of proposals translate into a new customer. That means AlphaX will need to send out 500 additional proposals in 2022.</p>



<p>Next, let’s look at the interest level after a demo is presented. 90% of people want a proposal, which means 556 additional demos will need to be booked.</p>



<p>Next, let’s look at how many people confirm a demo call after they fill out a form. 85% of people do that, which means 654 additional demo forms need to be submitted.</p>



<p>Lastly, let’s look at how many people fill out a demo form after visiting the website. 3% of people do that, which means 21,800 additional unique people need to visit the website per year.</p>



<p>With that information, we now have additional targets for each stage of our funnel per annum:</p>



<ul><li>Visitors: 21,800</li><li>Demo Form Submits: 654</li><li>Demo Presentations: 556</li><li>Proposals Sent: 500</li></ul>



<p>Monthly, we&#8217;re looking at an extra&#8230;</p>



<ul><li>Visitors: 1,816</li><li>Demo Form Submits: 55</li><li>Demo Presentations: 46</li><li>Proposals Sent: 42 </li></ul>



<p>The 20% goal is starting to get less scary, right? </p>



<div class="huemorProtip-container" style="background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><h2 class="huemorProtip-title" style="color:black">Protip</h2><p style="color:black" class="huemorProtip-description">Oftentimes when running new campaigns, numbers may perform worse than historical recordings. We suggest adding a 10-15% buffer to your goals and then re-evaluating quarterly to continue to fine-tune your goals.</p><div class="huemorProtip-button"></div></div>



<h2><strong>What If I Don’t Have This Data?</strong></h2>



<p>Ideally, in order for this approach to work, a company needs to have good tracking mechanisms in place. This means you have to have both accurate analytics and a CRM that’s kept up to date.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you don’t have those in place within your organization, a low-cost and effective way to set this up would be subscribing to a tool like <a href="https://www.pipedrive.com/">Pipedrive</a> and making sure <a href="https://analytics.google.com/">Google Analytics</a> is installed on your website.</p>



<p>If you don’t have this data, then I’d start with figuring out the following:</p>



<ul><li>Average Deal Value</li><li>Total Increase</li><li>Deal Number</li></ul>



<p>Next, figure out what your close rate is.</p>



<p>From there, you can do some research on what percentages are average for the various stages in your industry. For most B2B’s, we’ve observed the following:</p>



<ul><li>Form Submissions: 1-3%</li><li>Booked Calls: 50-70%</li><li>Proposals: 60-80%</li><li>Close Rate: 20-30%&nbsp;</li></ul>



<div class="huemorProtip-container" style="background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><h2 class="huemorProtip-title" style="color:black">Protip</h2><p style="color:black" class="huemorProtip-description">When starting a lead generation initiative many people are focused on improving their top-of-funnel metrics (visits). In reality, it&#8217;s likely easier to improve your mid-to-bottom funnel metrics (form submissions, booked calls, and close rate) </p><div class="huemorProtip-button">

</div></div>



<h2><strong>Wrapping Up</strong></h2>



<p>By following the steps above the marketing team was able to demystify their objectives and break things down into concrete numbers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This provides them with a clear understanding of what needs to be accomplished, and will now allow them to ideate on how to make those numbers a reality.</p>



<p>If you skip this step and jump immediately into tactics, you’re setting yourself up for failure.</p>



<h3><strong>Math Cheat Sheet</strong></h3>



<ul><li>Total Increase = (Annual Revenue x % Increase)</li><li>Deal Number = ((Annual Revenue x % Retention Rate) + (Total Increase) / (Average Deal Value))</li><li>Proposals Sent = (Deal Number / % Close Rate)</li><li>Presentations = (Proposals Sent / % Interested In Proposal)</li><li>Form Submissions = (Presentations / % Presentations Booked)</li><li>Visitors = (Form Submissions / % Form Conversion Rate)</li><li>Average Deal Value = (Total Sales / Total Number of Sales)</li><li>Close Rate = (Number of Deals Won / Number of Proposals Sent)</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you&#8217;re a B2B business, contact forms are absolutely critical for your inbound marketing efforts.</p>



<p>They&#8217;re what translates your hard work generating traffic into business opportunities.</p>



<p>So why do so many companies settle for underperforming contact forms?</p>



<span id="more-30669"></span>



<p>Many marketers for B2B businesses often overlook the importance of both the contents and style of their contact forms.</p>



<p>They assume that if someone is interested enough in the offer they&#8217;ll fill out anything. That is simply not true.</p>



<p>Just think about it — how many times have you abandoned a bad contact form experience? Most likely too many to count.</p>



<p>Contact forms that&#8230;</p>



<ul><li>Ask too many questions</li><li>Don&#8217;t make it obvious what&#8217;s required</li><li>Don&#8217;t make it obvious when you&#8217;ve completed something</li></ul>



<p>These poor decisions with contact forms hurt your business more than you&#8217;re probably even aware of.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re a marketer tasked with improving lead quality or volume for your business, improving your contact forms should be your first main objective.</p>



<p><meta charset="utf-8">Even small changes can have a huge impact on both the volume of inquiries you’ll receive and the quality of those opportunities.</p>



<p>In this article, we’ll be sharing research-backed conversion tips on how to improve your contact forms. We&#8217;ll also discuss more advanced ideas that B2B businesses can take advantage of to reduce the need for certain fields while still getting all the information you need from a prospect.</p>



<p>Ready to take your contact forms to the next level? Let&#8217;s dive in.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>10 UX Best Practices for Forms</strong></h2>



<p>Before we dive into the more advanced conversion tips, let’s cover some general contact form best practices from a user experience perspective. These tips are easy to understand and implement and are an effective way to<a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/how-to-improve-your-website" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> improve your website without a full redesign</a>.</p>



<h3><strong>Keep Your Forms Short</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="633" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Keep-Your-Forms-Short@2x-1024x633.jpg" alt="Keep Your Forms Short@2x" class="wp-image-30699" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Keep-Your-Forms-Short@2x-1024x633.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Keep-Your-Forms-Short@2x-300x185.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Keep-Your-Forms-Short@2x-768x475.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Keep-Your-Forms-Short@2x-1536x950.jpg 1536w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Keep-Your-Forms-Short@2x-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Keep-Your-Forms-Short@2x-36x22.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Keep-Your-Forms-Short@2x-48x30.jpg 48w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Keep-Your-Forms-Short@2x.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Attention spans around the world are<a href="https://psychminds.com/is-the-internet-destroying-our-attentions-span/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> decreasing with every passing year</a>, so the pressure is on your contact form to keep them engaged. The most straightforward way to accomplish this is to keep your form structure short.</p>



<p>By limiting the number of fields the user has to fill out upfront, the likelihood of form completion goes up by as much as 50%, as verified by a study from<a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/6746/Which-Types-of-Form-Fields-Lower-Landing-Page-Conversions.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Hubspot</a> that tested the effect of reducing the number of fields from 4 to 3. In addition,<a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/contact-form-conversion-rate/?display=wide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Quickspot</a> found that the conversion rate with only 3 fields was 25%, compared to 20% for 3-5 fields and 16% for 6+ fields. Keep in mind, however, that indiscriminately deleting fields might<a href="https://www.ventureharbour.com/how-form-length-impacts-conversion-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> hurt your conversion rate</a> instead — you need to know what fields your users want to fill out.</p>



<h3><strong>Make Sure Fields Are Consistently Sized</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="633" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Make-Sure-Fields-Are-Consistently-Sized@2x-1024x633.jpg" alt="Make Sure Fields Are Consistently Sized@2x" class="wp-image-30702" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Make-Sure-Fields-Are-Consistently-Sized@2x-1024x633.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Make-Sure-Fields-Are-Consistently-Sized@2x-300x185.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Make-Sure-Fields-Are-Consistently-Sized@2x-768x475.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Make-Sure-Fields-Are-Consistently-Sized@2x-1536x950.jpg 1536w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Make-Sure-Fields-Are-Consistently-Sized@2x-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Make-Sure-Fields-Are-Consistently-Sized@2x-36x22.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Make-Sure-Fields-Are-Consistently-Sized@2x-48x30.jpg 48w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Make-Sure-Fields-Are-Consistently-Sized@2x.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Our eyes follow the motion of our reading, so if your fields are inconsistently sized or unnecessarily long, it makes the experience of filling out your form less user-friendly. </p>



<p>Making sure your form fields are presented with a consistent size is part of form best practices. This improves the rhythm in which the user can easily read, understand, and progress through your forms.</p>



<p>Your site visitors and potential customers are not super likely to complete any long forms and will decrease your average conversion rate. Having optional fields can help lessen the intensity of a form&#8217;s appearance.</p>



<h3><strong>Users Can Tab Through Fields</strong></h3>



<p>Being able to easily tab through contact form fields in their intended order is incredibly helpful for your desktop users. This improves the speed at which they can complete your form. </p>



<p>This way potential customers and qualified leads can lead the conversation to only what fits for them and they want to get out of filling out your form. This can make things quicker for users do not have to fill out unnecessary form fields and shorten the overall form.</p>



<h3><strong>Keep Labels Visible</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="633" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Use-Placeholder-Text-Effectively-1.png" alt="Use Placeholder Text Effectively 1" class="wp-image-30684" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Use-Placeholder-Text-Effectively-1.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Use-Placeholder-Text-Effectively-1-300x185.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Use-Placeholder-Text-Effectively-1-768x475.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Use-Placeholder-Text-Effectively-1-24x15.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Use-Placeholder-Text-Effectively-1-36x22.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Use-Placeholder-Text-Effectively-1-48x30.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>If you’re trying to project a sleek, minimalist image on your business website, you may be tempted to remove labels in favor of just keeping placeholder text for form fields. Don’t do this — it hurts the user experience when they forget what field they’re filling out. It adds friction to the process when they have to erase their answers to verify they’re filling out the right field. </p>



<p>According to this<a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2557265" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> study from Google</a>, the most usable web forms have field labels above the corresponding input fields for quick reference.</p>



<h3><strong>Use Placeholder Text Effectively</strong></h3>



<p>Instead of using the placeholder text to repeat the label name, you should instead use it to present ideal formatting clues. This will ensure that the data entered in the fields better matches your ideal, making it easier for you to sort the information you’ve gathered. </p>



<p>This is especially relevant for fields that deal with information that can be formatted in many different ways, such as dates. Do you want them to enter January 3, 2022, 01/03/22, 03/01/2022, or 01-03-2022? Alternatively, you can also utilize dropdown menus to lessen confusion over formatting.</p>



<h3><strong>Have Clear Active States</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="633" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Clear-Active-State@2x-1024x633.jpg" alt="Clear Active State@2x" class="wp-image-30733" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Clear-Active-State@2x-1024x633.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Clear-Active-State@2x-300x185.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Clear-Active-State@2x-768x475.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Clear-Active-State@2x-1536x950.jpg 1536w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Clear-Active-State@2x-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Clear-Active-State@2x-36x22.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Clear-Active-State@2x-48x30.jpg 48w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Clear-Active-State@2x.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>When your user is actively editing a form field, make sure there are clear visual cues for them to know what they’re editing. You can accomplish this by highlighting the current field in a different color, making the lines more prominent, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Have Clear Error States</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="633" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Have-Clear-Error-States.png" alt="Have Clear Error States" class="wp-image-30680" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Have-Clear-Error-States.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Have-Clear-Error-States-300x185.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Have-Clear-Error-States-768x475.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Have-Clear-Error-States-24x15.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Have-Clear-Error-States-36x22.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Have-Clear-Error-States-48x30.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>If your user makes a mistake while filling out the form, make sure they know right away and it’s<a href="https://www.zuko.io/blog/a-guide-to-error-messages-in-online-forms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> clear what the error is</a>. </p>



<p>For example, if you are asking for their email address and they messed up the domain name, your error message can say “Please use standard domain format, e.g. johndoe@example.com” rather than “Invalid email address.” </p>



<p>Users tend to get frustrated from unclear error messages so by creating a clear and direct error message this will lessen the headache for you and your customers.</p>



<h3><strong>The Button Must Stand Out</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="633" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-Button-Must-Stand-Out.png" alt="The Button Must Stand Out" class="wp-image-30681" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-Button-Must-Stand-Out.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-Button-Must-Stand-Out-300x185.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-Button-Must-Stand-Out-768x475.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-Button-Must-Stand-Out-24x15.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-Button-Must-Stand-Out-36x22.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-Button-Must-Stand-Out-48x30.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>If the dominant color on your webpage is green, what should the color of your “submit” button be? If you think it should be green to match the rest of the page, then stop right there. </p>



<p>The best color for a call to action button, as reviewed by<a href="https://optinmonster.com/which-color-button-converts-best/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> OptinMonster</a>, is one that stands out from the rest of the page. In our previous example, the best color would be red, as it’s the complementary color on the opposite side of the color wheel. This helps draw attention and make the button obvious and visible to your users. </p>



<p>You should also ensure that the button has clear states for hover and click for even more visibility.</p>



<p>An additional tip for increasing the effectiveness of your call to action button is adding a<a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/how-to-use-testimonials/s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> testimonial</a> within the page. A good testimonial might just be the final push for someone to make that click as social proof can boost the number of sign ups your form gets (and your sales team will thank you later!)</p>



<h3><strong>Optimize Your Fields for Mobile</strong></h3>



<p>In 2020,<a href="https://www.perficient.com/insights/research-hub/mobile-vs-desktop-usage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> 68% of global website visits came from mobile</a> instead of desktop. This means that when you want to make a<a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/top-b2b-website-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> truly great B2B website</a>, you need to make sure it looks good on a mobile device. </p>



<p>Make sure your contact forms are optimized and you’re taking advantage of the right mobile keyboard functions per field and a user can easily cycle through the fields on their device. Since to make your short form mobile friendly you have to find of how mobile responsive your form is, due to this you might need to create a mobile version of your form that allows mobile users the ease of use when they are answering your form. </p>



<p>This may end up differing from the desktop version of your web form.</p>



<h3><strong>Make Sure There’s a Clear Confirmation</strong></h3>



<p>It’s frustrating when you click submit on a contact form and the website doesn’t tell you whether or not it worked. Should you wait and see if it gives you any confirmation? Should you fill it in again?</p>



<p>When your user completes the form, it should be obvious to them. An entirely separate “thank you” page is the most preferable option as well as one of the form design best practices for form completion.</p>



<h2><strong>What Form Fields You Actually Need</strong></h2>



<p>Now that we’re done with the general conversion tips, you might be thinking “Everyone says ‘make your form shorter,’ but what fields do I actually need to keep?” Let’s start with what people don’t like filling out:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="633" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/What-Form-Fields-You-Actually-Need@2x-1024x633.jpg" alt="What Form Fields You Actually Need@2x" class="wp-image-30704" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/What-Form-Fields-You-Actually-Need@2x-1024x633.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/What-Form-Fields-You-Actually-Need@2x-300x185.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/What-Form-Fields-You-Actually-Need@2x-768x475.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/What-Form-Fields-You-Actually-Need@2x-1536x950.jpg 1536w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/What-Form-Fields-You-Actually-Need@2x-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/What-Form-Fields-You-Actually-Need@2x-36x22.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/What-Form-Fields-You-Actually-Need@2x-48x30.jpg 48w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/What-Form-Fields-You-Actually-Need@2x.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In the era of data privacy concerns, people are more and more hesitant to give out information like phone numbers and address information. Even if you leave a note that says “We value your privacy. Your information is safe and will never be shared,” the person filling out your form has to take that promise at face value because you haven’t earned their trust yet. </p>



<p>If your contact form is currently asking for personal data, you’re likely putting yourself at a disadvantage. Asking for this information runs the risk of scaring off your users but it remains a<a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/biggest-website-redesign-mistakes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> common website mistake</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In reality, most B2B contact forms only need the following information:</p>



<ul><li>Name</li><li>Email Address</li></ul>



<p>Seriously, that’s it.</p>



<p>If that doesn’t feel like enough information, let’s talk about how you can gain more while still keeping your form as short as possible.</p>



<h2><strong>How To Improve Lead Quality</strong></h2>



<p>So, you now have a name and an email address. That’s plenty of information to start with — provided you use the correct tools.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Use Email Automation To Further Qualify</strong></h3>



<p>Getting people to fill in your contact form is the initial goal, but your overall goal is to nurture your leads and eventually convince them to buy your product or service. The first step to getting more information out of an email address is setting up email automation. </p>



<p>By using email automation to follow up on form submissions, you immediately accomplish two things: you ensure that the email address they submitted is valid and you begin the sales process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A crucial component to the latter objective is sending a personalized email instead of a dry general email. This immediately starts building trust and start to increase conversions. You can even use it to ask 3-5 additional questions you may need to know to qualify the prospect. </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s an example of an e-mail we automatically send after someone fills out a form:</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<div class="wp-container-6247425190575 wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<div class="wp-container-624742519018a wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<p><em>Hi First_Name,</em></p>



<p><em>To make sure we understand what you&#8217;re looking for, please share some information about your project:</em></p>



<ul><li><em>Are you looking for a single project or ongoing work? Or both?</em></li><li><em>What are the biggest challenges/obstacles with your current website?</em></li><li><em>What&#8217;s the project timeline/level of urgency?</em></li><li><em>How much are you looking to invest in this project/engagement?</em></li></ul>



<p>I<em>f you’ve already prepared some useful information, such as an RFP or scope of work, please feel free to attach it to your reply, we’d love to see it.</em></p>



<p><em>Looking forward to your response!</em></p>



<p><em>Cheers!</em></p>



<p><em>Jack Morrin</em></p>



<p><em>Sales Assistant</em></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>This simple touchpoint allows us to quickly create an additional touchpoint with the prospect and ask a few additional qualifying questions that are super important for our sales team. </p>

<div class="huemorProtip-container" style="background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><h2 class="huemorProtip-title" style="color:black">Protip</h2><p style="color:black" class="huemorProtip-description">Review the email follow-up questions above. Would you answer those if it was part of the initial form? Probably not. Keep the initial experience concise and engage more after the form has been submitted.</p><div class="huemorProtip-button"></div></div>



<h3><strong>Use 3rd Party Tools To Augment Data</strong></h3>



<p>You can use an email address for more than just sending emails — it’s 2022, technology is available to help you get data on prospects even if they didn’t personally submit that data to you. You can integrate a tool like<a href="https://clearbit.com/"> ClearBit</a> with your CRM to automatically pull information based on an email address, such as insights like their full name, job title, and company demographic information.</p>

<h2><strong>Why &amp; When To Use Multi-Step Forms</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="633" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mult-step-Form-Example@2x-1024x633.jpg" alt="Mult step Form Example@2x" class="wp-image-30735" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mult-step-Form-Example@2x-1024x633.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mult-step-Form-Example@2x-300x185.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mult-step-Form-Example@2x-768x475.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mult-step-Form-Example@2x-1536x950.jpg 1536w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mult-step-Form-Example@2x-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mult-step-Form-Example@2x-36x22.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mult-step-Form-Example@2x-48x30.jpg 48w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mult-step-Form-Example@2x.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>So, as we’ve previously established, you should be keeping your contact forms as short as possible and to roughly one page. However, what if you absolutely need that data? Applying contact form best practices to a form that requires more than 10 entries requires the use of multi-step forms with multiple fields.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After being told that you only truly need a name and an email address on the contact form, you might be confused as to why you would ever need a form long enough that it requires multiple steps. The reasoning is simple — it depends heavily on the purpose of your contact form.</p>



<p>Imagine that you’re shopping around for an estimate on the value of your house. You see a real estate agency that promises a free online estimate, but the only thing their form asks is a name and an email address. What insight could they possibly offer you with only that information?</p>



<p>Multi-step forms are amazing solutions for longer forms, such as an application or registration form. They’re also a good way to get more information from your leads — starting with “low-friction” or “low-threat” (e.g. what service are you looking for?) fields. </p>



<p>These can engage them and allow you to ask more sensitive questions near the end when it’s less likely for them to back out because they’ve already invested time and effort. Multi-step forms that include a progress bar are also effective at getting users to complete forms, due to the “<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/500480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">endowed progress effect</a>.”</p>



<p>When making a multi-step form, the same conversion tips apply. You should keep each batch of fields short so you don’t overwhelm the user. </p>



<p>A case study from<a href="http://ventureharbour.com/multi-step-lead-forms-get-300-conversions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Venture Harbour</a> saw a 53% increase in conversion rate when they formatted 30+ questions in a four-step form. Data from<a href="https://www.formstack.com/resources/report-form-conversion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Formstack</a> backs this up — multi-step forms have a completion rate of 13.85%, compared to 4.53% on a single long form.</p>



<h2><strong>Why &amp; When To Use Embedded Forms</strong></h2>



<p>Many businesses keep separate<a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/service-page-design-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> service pages</a> and contact form pages. However, forms that are directly embedded in landing pages tend to outperform CTAs to open a separate contact form page. The reasoning is, as always, convenience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whenever you can, you should try and incorporate a contact form directly on key landing pages, ideally above the fold of the page and again at the bottom of the landing page. It should also stand out from the rest of the web page elements so your user can find it easily.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re following the previously highlighted conversion tips (i.e. keeping forms concise), then this should be relatively easy to accomplish from a design perspective.</p>



<h2><strong>How To Keep Forms Secure (Without Hurting Conversions)</strong></h2>



<p>On paper, Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart or CAPTCHAs are a great way to reduce spam and ensure you’re getting quality information from your form, but did you know that visible CAPTCHAs actually hurt conversion rates?&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="633" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x-1024x633.jpg" alt="How To Keep Forms Secure@2x" class="wp-image-30706" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x-1024x633.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x-300x185.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x-768x475.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x-1536x950.jpg 1536w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x-36x22.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x-48x30.jpg 48w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>According to this case study from<a href="https://moz.com/blog/captchas-affect-on-conversion-rates"> Moz</a>, having CAPTCHA on reduced the amount of spam conversions by 4.1% but companies could actually lose out on 3.2% of genuine conversions. This is likely because CAPTCHA has become too difficult and confusing, in an effort to combat the increasing sophistication of spambots. </p>



<p>It simply isn’t user-friendly — who wants to take the time to puzzle over a distorted set of letters or numbers and painstakingly type them out?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead of using CAPTCHA, you can look to alternatives that are convenient or invisible to the front-end user but still keep spam and brute force attacks at bay. One such example is Google’s<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/12/3/7325925/google-is-killing-captcha-as-we-know-it" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> reCAPTCHA</a>, which can be as simple as clicking a checkbox.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Tracking Performance &amp; Making Improvements</strong></h2>



<p>Whenever you make any type of changes to your contact forms, it is downright impossible to truly understand their impact without tracking performance. Here are three key tests and methods you should be using to track improvements:</p>



<h3><strong>Set Up Goals</strong></h3>



<p>Using<a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Google Analytics</a> (or your preferred analytics tool), make sure each form on your website has a unique goal attached to it for completion. This will give you a better understanding of the success rate of filling out these forms.</p>



<h3><strong>Use Behavior Tracking</strong></h3>



<p>Using tools like<a href="https://www.hotjar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Hotjar</a> or<a href="https://www.luckyorange.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> LuckyOrange</a> will provide you with a better understanding of how people are interacting with your contact forms in real-time. This could help you identify drop-off points or even bugs within the forms themselves.</p>



<h3><strong>Split Test</strong></h3>



<p>Tools like<a href="https://www.optimizely.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Optimizely</a>,<a href="https://vwo.com/platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> VWO</a>, and<a href="https://www.convert.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Convert</a> allow you to easily and effectively set up split tests. In these scenarios, you can run variations of form configurations side by side and understand how they truly are performing. </p>



<p>Split tests can help you pinpoint which elements of your contact forms help or harm your conversion rate. The more tests you perform, the better optimized your form will be by the end.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Wrapping Up</strong></h2>



<p>That finishes our rundown of contact form best practices. Contact forms are one of the biggest opportunities for businesses to improve both the quality and quantity of leads, so make sure you never neglect to optimize them. Always keep these three conversion tips in mind:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Keep them as concise as possible.</li><li>Use other methods to get the additional info you need.</li><li>Test and monitor all of your improvements to maximize your results.</li></ul>



<p>Remember, at the end of the day a good contact form is one that provides a pleasant user experience, and you can’t have that with clunky fields or long pages.

<p>Alright, so here&#8217;s the scenario. You&#8217;re a marketing manager in charge of ensuring certain goals are accomplished for your organization.</p>



<span id="more-29674"></span>



<p>There&#8217;s a problem, though. You don&#8217;t have either the time or the budget to do a <a href="/blog/website-redesign" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complete website redesign</a>.</p>



<p>What do you do?</p>



<p>There are a ton of ways one can go about improving a website, but we&#8217;ve taken the liberty to narrow them down to the 10 things we feel will make the BIGGEST impact on your website WITHOUT having to redesign the entire thing from the ground up. So how do you improve your website? Get ready to ways to improve your website design!</p>



<h2>Make It Faster</h2>



<p>User experience is greatly influenced by the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/speed-up-a-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speed of a website</a>. <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/data-measurement/mobile-page-speed-new-industry-benchmarks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Google</a>, increasing loading times from one to three seconds raises the likelihood of a visitor abandoning the website by 32%.</p>



<p>Site speed also plays a vital role in conversion rates. In fact, <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-strategies/app-and-mobile/mobile-page-speed-conversion-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research by Google</a> reveals that conversions might drop by up to 20% for every second that a mobile page takes to load. Furthermore, faster websites can lift conversion rates by up to 40%.</p>



<p>In many cases, speeding up your website and website design can be relatively easy to do. Here are <a href="https://www.hostgator.com/blog/fix-slow-loading-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some quick fixes</a> that can make your site load faster:</p>



<ul><li>Compress and optimize your images and videos</li><li>Limit the amount that loads on a single page</li><li>Enable caching</li><li>Use a CDN</li></ul>



<p>Improving website overall page speed is critical for attracting visitors and keeping them interested.</p>



<div class="huemorProtip-container" style="background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><h2 class="huemorProtip-title" style="color:black">Protip</h2><p style="color:black" class="huemorProtip-description">If you&#8217;re interested in learning more about what we can do for you, check out our offers <a href="https://huemor.rocks/services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>!</p><div class="huemorProtip-button"></div></div>



<h2>Make It Consistent</h2>



<p>Design is all about consistency. The consistency of your website&#8217;s design and content is critical if you want to give your visitors a pleasant online experience. It can make the difference between a good and bad user experience.</p>



<p>Even if you&#8217;re not in love with your visual design, it may be made worse by being inconsistent. Make sure that fonts, font sizes, font weights, colors, treatments to elements such as corner rounding, and borders are consistent across all pages. This will improve how professional the website appears regardless of whether or not the web design is the best it can be.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="543" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/consistency-glossier.jpg" alt="consistency glossier" class="wp-image-30200" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/consistency-glossier.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/consistency-glossier-300x159.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/consistency-glossier-768x407.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/consistency-glossier-24x13.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/consistency-glossier-36x19.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/consistency-glossier-48x25.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption> <a href="https://www.glossier.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glossier</a> </figcaption></figure>



<p>For example, consistency is evident on the <a href="https://www.glossier.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glossier</a> website because it employs a color palette that matches its products. It is also able to add a few splashes of color to each page without going excessive or deviating from its identity. Also make the most of your website&#8217;s white space, do not over crowd your website with unneeded content but also do not leave blank canvas blank!</p>



<h2>Improve Your Opening Statement</h2>



<p>The copy on your homepage has a significant impact on its success. It&#8217;ll be the first thing visitors see when they come to your website and can be used as a brief &#8220;elevator pitch&#8221; to explain the purpose of your site. As a result, your website&#8217;s opening statement must be engaging.</p>



<p>You should have a clear opening statement that makes it obvious what you do, who you do it for, and why you do it. If you don&#8217;t, then you&#8217;re starting off on the wrong foot with your potential customers. Improving this statement will immediately help prospective customers connect with your company.</p>



<p>For instance, <a href="http://kabertech.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaber Tech</a> features an excellent opening statement on their website. They have a catchy headline and a statement that illustrates what makes their products different.</p>



<h2>Re-organize Your Website Navigation</h2>



<p>One of the most crucial aspects of a website is its navigation. It helps visitors quickly and effortlessly discover the content they&#8217;re looking for, such as a blog post or a product page.</p>



<p>To make your website navigation effective, make sure all of your key pages are being represented. What are those key pages? These are areas of your site that are popular with visitors. You can use Google Analytics to help you understand what those pages are. Using the <a href="https://measureschool.com/navigation-report-google-analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Navigation Summary Report feature</a>, you&#8217;ll learn which pages people go to the most. This also ensures that the navigation is intuitive to how your customers would browse the website.</p>



<p>Another crucial factor is to make sure the navigation isn&#8217;t overwhelming. The navigation menu on your website is not the place for amusing gimmicks. Use the cleanest design and wording possible to ensure that your audience understands what you&#8217;re trying to convey. In addition, the adage &#8220;less is more&#8221; applies. Don&#8217;t bombard guests with too many items on your menu.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="543" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/navigation-gleamin.jpg" alt="navigation gleamin" class="wp-image-30199" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/navigation-gleamin.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/navigation-gleamin-300x159.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/navigation-gleamin-768x407.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/navigation-gleamin-24x13.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/navigation-gleamin-36x19.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/navigation-gleamin-48x25.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption> <a href="http://gleamin.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gleamin</a> (Check out our <a href="https://huemor.rocks/case-studies/gleamin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">case study</a>) </figcaption></figure>



<p>Over time websites grow, but often navigation systems don&#8217;t grow with them. As such, it&#8217;s essential to update your website navigation regularly for the best possible user experience.</p>



<p>An example of a website that has excellent navigation is <a href="https://www.stories.com/en_usd/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Other Stories</a>. The site features clear navigation options that allow users to easily find different product categories.</p>



<div class="huemorProtip-container" style="background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><h2 class="huemorProtip-title" style="color:black">Protip</h2><p style="color:black" class="huemorProtip-description">Check out our article for more detailed tips on how to design a truly effective <a href="/blog/website-navigation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">website navigation</a>.</p><div class="huemorProtip-button"></div></div>



<h2>Add Social Proof</h2>



<p>Your website will soar if you provide social proof. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2021/10/07/4-powerful-ways-to-show-social-proof-on-your-website/?sh=5c71a0d92479" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social proof</a> is a marketing approach based on the premise that if people witness others doing something, they are more inclined to do it themselves. If a shopper is undecided about what you&#8217;re offering, they will frequently look or ask around to see what others say about it before making a purchase. Potential buyers get the impression that they&#8217;re not by themselves. <a href="https://geekflare.com/social-proof-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social proof</a> lets them know that many people believe in the brand and use it to their advantage. As a result, they have many good reasons to put it to use for themselves as well.</p>



<p>One way to show social proof on your website is to add testimonials or reviews. This can help you gain a lot of new customers. In fact, <a href="https://bizrateinsights.com/resources/shopper-survey-report-the-impact-reviews-have-on-consumers-purchase-decisions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">91% of customers</a> read internet reviews before purchasing something. Furthermore, testimonials can boost <a href="https://www.impactbnd.com/blog/whats-changed-with-social-proof-in-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sales page conversions by 34%</a>.</p>



<div class="huemorProtip-container" style="background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><h2 class="huemorProtip-title" style="color:black">Protip</h2><p style="color:black" class="huemorProtip-description">Want to learn more out how to use use testimonials on your website? Read more <a href="/blog/how-to-use-testimonials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>!</p><div class="huemorProtip-button"></div></div>



<p>Including ratings and reviews on your website allows your visitors to see what other people have to say. Make sure they&#8217;re on crucial pages, that they serve to reinforce what you&#8217;re offering, and that they were made recently by previous customers.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.wearfigs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Figs</a> demonstrates how social proof can be used on a website. Their product pages feature a tab where customers can check ratings and reviews.</p>



<h2>Simplify Contact Forms</h2>



<p>An effective contact form is one of the most crucial parts of your website. A potential customer has no idea how trustworthy you and your product are. They might have concerns about how to use your product, or they might want to put your customer support to the test by asking a query and seeing what kind of response they get.</p>



<p>Because contact forms are used to link online visitors with their objectives, design and user experience can heavily influence conversion rates. Here are some ways to simplify your contact forms.</p>



<h3>Shorter Contact Forms Perform Better</h3>



<p>When a form has too many fields, it can be too much for people to handle, and they may abandon it. Reducing the number of needed fields makes it easier to fill out the form and prevents the user from feeling overwhelmed. According to <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/contact-form-conversion-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QuickSprout research</a>, a three-field form had a 25% conversion rate. Those percentages were lowered to 20% for up to 5 fields and 15% for more than 6 fields. As a result, the maximum number of fields should be 5, and the tab order should be correct.</p>



<h3>Keep What You Need To Know to the Bare Minimum</h3>



<p>As a general rule, people are reluctant to share personal details such as their contact number or address. Asking for these details can result in a high rate of form abandonment. According to <a href="https://komarketing.com/resources/b2b-web-usability-report-2015/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KoMarketing</a>, phone numbers are the most common piece of information that consumers do not want to enter on a form, at 58%. This is even more relevant nowadays, given the rise in the number of spam calls. Home address closely follows at 53%.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="839" height="539" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Contact-form-ARM-1.jpg" alt="Contact form ARM 1" class="wp-image-30198" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Contact-form-ARM-1.jpg 839w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Contact-form-ARM-1-300x193.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Contact-form-ARM-1-768x493.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Contact-form-ARM-1-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Contact-form-ARM-1-36x23.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Contact-form-ARM-1-48x31.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 839px) 100vw, 839px" /><figcaption> <a href="https://arm-creative.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ARM Creative</a> (Check out our <a href="https://huemor.rocks/case-studies/arm-creative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">case study</a>) </figcaption></figure>



<h3>Less Friction = More Conversions</h3>



<p>When designing a contact form, you should focus on making it as easy as possible for people to get in touch with you. Ensure that the user can quickly and progressively move through the fields by arranging the tab order. The final tab arrangement of the Submit and Cancel buttons is critical to avoid users from mistakenly canceling the form. Another option to reduce friction is to use in-line validation. Before submitting an inquiry, certain Javascripts can notify visitors if their email address is incorrect. Nothing is more frustrating than having to find an error after you&#8217;ve already tried to submit your data.</p>



<h2>Add New Ways To Capture Contact Information</h2>



<p>Not everyone visiting your website will be ready to buy, but they may be in the future. As such, it will be to your advantage if you can collect the contact information of potential leads. Gathering email addresses from your website visitors is vital to building a community of loyal customers. Email marketing has also been proven to have one of the highest returns on investment among digital marketing strategies at <a href="https://www.lyfemarketing.com/blog/email-marketing-roi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">122%</a>.</p>



<p>Here are some improvements you can make on your site that can create additional opportunities for people to reveal who they are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Use newsletter opt-in forms on your website:</strong> Creating opt-in forms that let users submit their email and sign up for your emails is the easiest and quickest way to gather email addresses.</li><li><strong>Add new forms that offer specific resources or content:</strong> This might be in the form of an eBook, white paper, webinar, or anything else that provides consumers with essential knowledge.</li></ul>



<h2>Create New Content</h2>



<p>Quality content distinguishes your website from the competition and sends the right message to your customers&#8217; hearts and minds. Your website&#8217;s success is driven mainly by its content. As such, you need to focus on creating new content relevant to your target audience. This could be new service pages, new case studies, white papers, ebooks, and blog posts. Fresh content shows you&#8217;re still moving forward, are active, and are a successful business.</p>



<p>Building relationships with your customers is one of the main benefits of producing quality content. You&#8217;ll be able to answer their inquiries and engage with them. Content has the power to create pleasant customer experiences and encourage them to return for more.</p>



<h2>Update Photos and Videos</h2>



<p>Audiovisual elements such as photographs, illustrations, and videos look fantastic on a website and help engage visitors by breaking up text-heavy sections. However, keeping your media up-to-date is also crucial in improving website performance.</p>



<p>Check the corporate headshots on your site. Are they more than five years out of date? If so, then it&#8217;s time to update them. Posting new photos of projects and facilities can also help show growth.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/644959901?h=ee6c13e634&amp;dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption> <a href="https://agamerica.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AgAmerica</a> (Check out our <a href="https://huemor.rocks/case-studies/ag-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">case study</a>) </figcaption></figure>



<p>Make sure your visual elements are of the highest quality and relevance. Take note of anything that appears grainy, pixelated, or out-of-date. You can come across photos that aren&#8217;t relevant anymore or aren&#8217;t consistent with your current branding. Removing or replacing these elements can give your website a new and fresh look. Even if your website template isn&#8217;t brand new, new images and videos can still elevate your website.</p>



<h2>Clean-Up 404&#8217;s</h2>



<p>A 404 error is issued when a server is unable to locate the precise URL that the browser has requested. It&#8217;s the dreaded screen that reads: &#8220;this page cannot be found.&#8221; Individually, 404 errors may appear insignificant, but their cumulative effect on a site can be severe. 404 errors on a business website are a surefire way to lose money and irritate visitors at the same time.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="543" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/404-huemor.jpg" alt="404 huemor" class="wp-image-30197" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/404-huemor.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/404-huemor-300x159.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/404-huemor-768x407.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/404-huemor-24x13.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/404-huemor-36x19.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/404-huemor-48x25.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>First and foremost, 404 errors hurt SEO. Google and other search engines won&#8217;t index pages that return a 404 error code because it means the page doesn&#8217;t exist. Furthermore, they also hurt user experience. 404 errors can be frustrating for visitors and cause them to leave a website. Because of this, you&#8217;ll see a rise in the bounces and exit rates of your site. Customers and sales can potentially be lost due to 404 errors.</p>



<p>For these reasons, you must identify and fix these broken links. You can achieve this using tools like <a href="https://ahrefs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ahrefs</a>.</p>

<p>Are you wondering how to use testimonials to effectively draw prospective customers to your website? More importantly, are you wondering why you need customer testimonials on your website in the first place? All great questions, so let&#8217;s dive right in!</p>



<p>Getting the trust of your audience, as well as potential buyers is the most important part of getting more conversions. To do this, you need to use customer testimonials. Below are a few tips and testimonial examples to help your website (and, ultimately, your business):</p>



<span id="more-29676"></span>



<div class="ChapterFullwidth" style="background-image:url(https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-form">
<a id="chapter 1"></a>
</div><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">CHAPTER 1</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">What is the Goal of a Testimonial?</h2></div></div>



<p>Testimonials are used to boost the confidence of your prospective customers. Seeing that your products or services are reliable, they will trust your business more and the quality that it has. Testimonials are often used to generate leads and attain new customers for this reason.</p>



<p>Along with this, testimonials build trust with your audience because they back up the claims you’ve made about what your business does best. Anybody can say “my products are the best on the market.” But can everyone prove it? More often than not, no. Testimonials are a way to stand out in an industry with a lot of sales claims and limited data &#8212; or perhaps false data &#8212; to back them up.</p>



<div class="ChapterFullwidth" style="background-image:url(https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-form">
<a id="chapter 2"></a>
</div><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">CHAPTER 2</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">Why are Testimonials Effective?</h2></div></div>



<p>Testimonials lead to sales for two main reasons:</p>



<h3>They Add a Human Quality</h3>



<p>A lot of data can feel very impersonal. While you can prove to the world that you have X number of 5-star reviews, it’s the content of those reviews that really matter to customers. It’s how they can identify with your product or service and see themselves using it.</p>



<p>Testimonials are, of course, not reviews. But in a similar sense, the content of these testimonials will matter to your customers. Providing a human quality will allow them to relate with or sympathize with the experiences of the customers in testimonials, especially if these testimonials discuss pain points. Seeing that someone else found the solution in your business will entice them to do the same.</p>



<h3>They Create Social Proof</h3>



<p>You’ve probably heard of <a href="https://www.dynamicyield.com/glossary/social-proof/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social proof</a> before, but just as a recap, social proof is when someone uses a product or service, and then creates a chain reaction of people doing the same thing. This does not have to be a celebrity or a billionaire. It just needs to be someone that people respect and trust. Getting a testimonial from a trusted source will inevitably send customers your way looking to be like that person, or be liked by society.</p>



<p>Alternatively, a large amount of testimonials can create social proof, since people will think, “Since everyone else is doing it, I should be, too.” Ideally, you should have a mix of testimonials from people that others look up to, as well as ordinary people that fit your target demographic.</p>



<div class="ChapterFullwidth" style="background-image:url(https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-form">
<a id="chapter 3"></a>
</div><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">CHAPTER 3</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">Testimonials vs. Data and Statistics</h2></div></div>



<p>When customers want to see just how honest you are as a company, they will look for two key pieces of evidence — testimonials or data and statistics. In order to build a website that truly captures your viewers’ attention, you will need to have both placed strategically on your website.</p>



<h3>Testimonials</h3>



<p>This kind of evidence shows the quality of certain products and services, focusing on what appeals to the hearts and emotions of their target audience. As mentioned, testimonials will always come from someone who has already tried the product or service, which means they are speaking from experience.</p>

<h3>Data and Statistics</h3>



<p>This involves qualitative evidence. Think graphs, charts, figures, and the like. For example, you could conduct a survey showing how many customers are satisfied with your services.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="400" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Data-Statistics-extensis.jpg" alt="Data Statistics extensis" class="wp-image-30212" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Data-Statistics-extensis.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Data-Statistics-extensis-300x117.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Data-Statistics-extensis-768x300.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Data-Statistics-extensis-24x9.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Data-Statistics-extensis-36x14.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Data-Statistics-extensis-48x19.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://huemor.rocks/case-studies/extensishr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ExtensisHR Case Study</a></figcaption></figure>

</div><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">CHAPTER 4</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">How to Get a Great Testimonial</h2></div></div>



<h2>How to Get a Great Testimonial</h2>



<p>Now that you understand how testimonials work and just how effective they can be, you probably want some on your own website. This is a great idea but if you don’t have a customer base just yet, this won’t be easy to do. Nevertheless, you can put systems in place to get testimonials in the future.</p>



<h3>Do an Amazing Job</h3>



<p>This one is kind of obvious, but it’s the most important thing you can do for your company and brand. If you want to get good testimonials throughout your website, you have to deliver a great product or experience for your customers. Not just once or twice, but consistently — doing this each time a customer makes a purchase will lead to testimonials down the line.</p>



<h3>Ask for Testimonials</h3>



<p>A lot of companies assume that testimonials will willingly come to them, but this isn’t actually true. People will usually have better things to do than take the time to sit down and write something nice about a product they used or a service they booked. The best way to compel people to do this is to have a set of processes to ask for positive reviews with every satisfactory customer experience.</p>



<p>Ensure that you have a team to take charge of customer interactions, such as CSRs or managers, who can follow a clear set of processes. We suggest starting with fans who love your products and services. Because of this, they could already be interested or willing to help you in any way they can. All that’s left to do is ask.</p>



<h4>Email Example</h4>



<p>Whenever you’re sending an email asking for a testimonial, it needs to be concise, yet polite. A long email will confuse the sendee, and a rude email will turn them away. As such, these are the two highest priorities when sending an email.</p>



<p>Here is a template email for your reference:</p>



<p><em>Dear ____,</em></p>



<p><em>Would you be alright with writing us a short testimonial? We’re looking to update our website, and it would help us out. I can send you something to base it off of, or you can just write us a couple of sentences relating to your experiences with our company.</em></p>



<p><em>Please don’t feel obligated to do this, however. If you’d like to decline, that is completely okay. Just let me know.</em></p>



<p><em>Thank you!</em></p>



<p>Naturally, you’ll want to adjust the tone of this template depending on the way your company is branded. You might want it to be more formal than it already is, or more conversational.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, no matter how they respond, following this guideline will allow you to get what you came for nine times out of ten &#8212; a testimonial.</p>



<h3>Use Third-Party Sites for Testimonials</h3>



<p>It’s a good idea to have your customers use third-party websites where they can leave testimonials or reviews. While these third-party sites can vary depending on the industry you’re in, there are many common platforms that you can rely on, such as:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.google.com/business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Business</a></li><li><a href="https://www.g2.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">G2</a></li><li><a href="https://www.yelp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yelp</a></li><li><a href="https://foursquare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foursquare</a></li><li><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TripAdvisor</a></li><li><a href="https://www.zomato.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zomato</a></li></ul>



<p>Doing this will allow you to broaden the exposure your website receives while adding another layer of authenticity for your business. By maintaining your profile on third-party sites, you can show audiences that you are a legitimate business by having recent photos, current information, and top reviews.</p>



<p>Furthermore, having an active account that shows up-to-date information will boost results within search engines. As a result, you’ll gain the attention of more people and attract more visitors to your company and brand.</p>



<p>Along with this, third-party websites will usually display snippets to visually represent your website as soon as search results come in.</p>



<p>Bonus review source &#8211; social media! Go through your social media feed to see what feedback previous consumers have shared. This is a great way to collect feedback from real people as well! Just make sure your customer is okay with you sharing their thoughts as you want to continue to build trust for your brand.</p>

<p>Now you’re probably wondering how to write a testimonial. This will be useful when you’re making those drafts inside your emails to send to your customers. Here are a few tips on how to write effective testimonials:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="400" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Ag-America-Testimonial-1.jpg" alt="Ag America Testimonial 1" class="wp-image-30218" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Ag-America-Testimonial-1.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Ag-America-Testimonial-1-300x117.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Ag-America-Testimonial-1-768x300.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Ag-America-Testimonial-1-24x9.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Ag-America-Testimonial-1-36x14.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Ag-America-Testimonial-1-48x19.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://huemor.rocks/case-studies/ag-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-size: 12px;">AgAmerica Case Study</span></a></figcaption></figure>



<h3>Only Include Testimonials that Have Been Received Ethically</h3>



<p>This is probably another obvious piece of advice but we’ll say it anyway: Don’t invent fake testimonials. Every testimonial on your website should be 100% authentic.</p>



<p>This doesn’t mean you can paraphrase something a customer said once, either. It needs to be straight from them, and with their permission.</p>



<h3>A Good Testimonial is Concise</h3>



<p>A short and concise testimonial is the best way to deliver a message that you want people to know about. Ideally, it will have between 30 to 50 words to ensure that people will read it, rather than find a shorter one that they can easily comprehend.</p>



<p>Avoid using super-long messages — while your customers may love your work, be sure to ask for their approval to edit these down to an appropriate amount.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="400" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Concise-testimonial-1.jpg" alt="Concise testimonial 1" class="wp-image-30220" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Concise-testimonial-1.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Concise-testimonial-1-300x117.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Concise-testimonial-1-768x300.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Concise-testimonial-1-24x9.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Concise-testimonial-1-36x14.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Concise-testimonial-1-48x19.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://huemor.rocks/case-studies/coverfx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CoverFX Case Study</a></figcaption></figure>



<h3>A Good Testimonial is Direct</h3>



<p>As mentioned, you don’t need paragraphs and paragraphs of good words about your company. Upfront and direct messages will have more of an impact on those who read them compared to long messages. Long messages will only drown potential buyers in words, creating confusion. A testimonial that’s straight to the point makes it more understandable for your audience.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="400" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/BetterCloud-Testimonial.jpg" alt="BetterCloud Testimonial" class="wp-image-30221" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/BetterCloud-Testimonial.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/BetterCloud-Testimonial-300x117.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/BetterCloud-Testimonial-768x300.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/BetterCloud-Testimonial-24x9.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/BetterCloud-Testimonial-36x14.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/BetterCloud-Testimonial-48x19.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://huemor.rocks/case-studies/better-cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BetterCloud Case Study</a></figcaption></figure>



<h3>A Good Testimonial is Authentic</h3>



<p>It only makes sense that the more information there is in a testimonial, the more authentic and credible it is. A testimonial should have a person’s name, title, picture, and in some cases, their company.</p>



<p>Along with this, the best testimonials will show the personality of the person leaving them, conveying emotion and leaving readers to experience their happiness with the product or service secondhand.</p>

<h3>Some Aren’t Written At All</h3>



<p>Video testimonials are a great way to present the story of how a person truly feels about the service or product you offer. When a potential buyer sees someone, hears their tone, and views their mannerisms, it can truly add a lot of credibility.</p>



<p>Visual endorsements are also more engaging. According to Forbes, viewers are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/yec/2017/07/13/how-to-incorporate-video-into-your-social-media-strategy/?sh=5e4f3bda7f2e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">95% more likely</a> to understand and keep the message of a video compared to text. It is all about tailoring your content to what your potential customers want to know from real people and clients. This increases the likelihood they will purchase a product or service from your business as well as help to boost sales.</p>

</div><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">CHAPTER 6</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">What&#8217;s the Anatomy of an Effective Testimonial?</h2></div></div>



<p>While having testimonials is great, you shouldn’t just post them for the sake of having them on your website. You also need to make sure that we have a few key components in place to ensure that you don’t lose your credibility. Here are a few things to consider:</p>



<h3>Is it Relevant?</h3>



<p>Be sure to check if the testimonial actually talks about your business — it’s easy to fill pages with testimonials but do they actually matter to your business today? Make sure that they capture your audiences’ attention by picking out only the most relevant pieces for your business.</p>



<p>A relevant testimonial will talk about the specific products and services you offer or anything new that you will soon be offering. They will also remain consistent regarding who you are as a company and what you represent.</p>



<h3>Is there an Identifiable Source?</h3>



<p>As mentioned, a credible testimonial will come from a source that you can identify and shouldn’t be anonymous.</p>



<p>For B2B companies, a testimonial will ideally have:</p>



<ul><li>A person’s name</li><li>Their job title</li><li>Their company</li><li>Their photo</li></ul>



<p>However, if you find that a customer may not want to include a photo, a logo of their company would suffice as well. Here is an example of what a testimonial for B2B companies with an identifiable source should look like:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Quirk-b2b-testimonial.jpg" alt="Quirk b2b testimonial" class="wp-image-30223" width="840" height="328" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Quirk-b2b-testimonial.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Quirk-b2b-testimonial-300x117.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Quirk-b2b-testimonial-768x300.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Quirk-b2b-testimonial-24x9.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Quirk-b2b-testimonial-36x14.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Quirk-b2b-testimonial-48x19.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://huemor.rocks/case-studies/quirk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-size: 12px;">Quirk Creative Case Study</span></a></figcaption></figure>



<p>For D2C companies, a testimonial will ideally have:</p>



<ul><li>A person’s name</li><li>Their photo</li></ul>



<p>Here’s an example of these kinds of testimonials for D2C companies:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="838" height="375" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Gleamin-D2C-testimonial-1-2.jpg" alt="Gleamin D2C testimonial 1 2" class="wp-image-30224" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Gleamin-D2C-testimonial-1-2.jpg 838w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Gleamin-D2C-testimonial-1-2-300x134.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Gleamin-D2C-testimonial-1-2-768x344.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Gleamin-D2C-testimonial-1-2-24x11.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Gleamin-D2C-testimonial-1-2-36x16.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Gleamin-D2C-testimonial-1-2-48x21.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 838px) 100vw, 838px" /><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://gleamin.com">gleamin.com</a></figcaption></figure>

<a id="chapter 7"></a>
</div><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">CHAPTER 7</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">Where to Include Testimonials?</h2></div></div>



<p>No matter the kind of industry you belong to or the nature of your business, there are places on your website where testimonials need to be to produce the most desirable results. Here are just a few of those areas:</p>



<h3>Key Landing Pages</h3>



<p>Placing testimonials on your key landing pages will provide the best area for potential customers or buyers to see just how great your brand or company is. Also, having testimonials on your products or services pages will provide you with the opportunity to back up any claims you might have.</p>



<div class="huemorProtip-container" style="background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><h2 class="huemorProtip-title" style="color:black">Protip</h2><p style="color:black" class="huemorProtip-description">Much like in this example, ensure that your claims are paired with relevant testimonials. Doing this will greatly boost the effectiveness of these claims.</p><div class="huemorProtip-button"></div></div>



<h3>Your Success Stories / Portfolio / Case Studies</h3>



<p>This is where you can provide both quantitative data in the form of data &amp; statistics of outcomes as well as qualitative data using customer testimonials. As previously mentioned, having a combination of both will win over your customers’ hearts and minds.</p>



<div class="hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed" style="width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 1920px; max-height: 1080px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;">
<div class="hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;"><iframe class="hs-responsive-embed-iframe" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;" src="//player.vimeo.com/video/642720112?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=8dc7dc&amp;background=1" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-service="vimeo" width="1920" height="1080" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
</div>



<h3>Contact Pages and Checkout</h3>



<p>Having a testimonial within your <a href="https://smashballoon.com/how-to-display-testimonials-on-your-website/#reviews-on-contact-pages" target="_blank" rel="noopener">checkout or contact page</a> can be the final touch of persuasion that you need. This could just be what you need to push someone to make the decision to buy your products or services. To make this as effective as possible, make sure to save your best testimonials for last.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Breakups are the worst!</p>



<span id="more-29680"></span>



<p>Rarely does it matter who you’re ending things with. Whether it’s your significant other or your boss, parting ways can be awkward and accompanied by all sorts of emotions.</p>



<p>All breakups have one thing in common — all came after a period of good experiences. Your website design agency and yourself may have shared a positive business relationship, but anything can come to an end.</p>



<p>When it comes to severing ties with your website design agency, breaking up can be a little complicated.</p>



<p>For starters, you can lose your website and its content if things turn sour. In addition, your website design agency can make the sunsetting process a little more challenging if you aren’t careful yourself.</p>



<p>Anybody can terminate the services of an agency. However, only marketing managers worth their salt can do so with class and caution. In this article, we’ll fill you in on how to do just that and more.</p>



<p>So, stick around, put away the tissues, and read on before you change to a new website design agency!</p>



<h2>Define Your “Why”</h2>



<p>Now, we’d never recommend staying in an already exhausting relationship. Indeed, there are clear signs that it’s time to terminate the services of your website design agency.</p>



<p>Sometimes, it pays to take a step back, breathe, and evaluate the relationship. More specifically, ask yourself why you want to part ways with your website design agency.</p>



<p>A few hiccups here and there may not be good enough reasons to end things. These reasons, on the other hand, might be.</p>



<h3>1. The Agency Is Stuck in the Stone Age</h3>



<p>Building a new site has gone a long way since the 90s. Even several Content management system (CMS) platforms from the early 2000s seem obsolete to today’s no-code variety.</p>



<p>Has your agency been using the same platform for decades, or even half that time? Then, there’s a chance your site will miss out on innovations to build your online presence.</p>



<p>In truth, innovations in site development and design are popping up left and right. An agency worth its salt should jump on the opportunity to incorporate whatever useful innovations they have.</p>



<p>For most agencies, the limiting factor is the ability to adapt to change. If changing platforms or improving on them is too difficult for an agency, it may deem your interests as secondary.</p>



<p>The continued use of obsolete platforms, while mildly effective, may be a sign that it’s time to change things up. And, we don’t mean the platform, but your web design agency.</p>



<h3>2. It Seems They’ve Got Too Much on Their Plate</h3>



<p>Yes, it’s possible for your web agency to cheat on you.</p>



<p>Kidding aside, a web agency that’s got a lot of clients on board isn’t always something to admire. In fact, when it comes to your website, it might be bad news.</p>



<p>Few will deny that getting overloaded as an agency isn’t far-fetched or unlikely. But, when this happens, through nobody’s fault, some projects will fall by the wayside.</p>



<p>In such scenarios, prioritization can be challenging for the company. If you’ve observed that your web agency is living up to its end of your contract, you can stick with it.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if you’ve learned that the agency has taken on many other projects concurrent to a drop in quality, it’s time to move on.</p>



<p>Once again, it’s all about proper prioritization and management. This conveniently brings us to the next red flag before switching web design agencies.</p>



<h3>3. Poor Project Management</h3>



<p>Web design agencies handle projects using a team-based approach.</p>



<p>For instance, one person handles communication with clients (that means you). Other people are responsible for web development (all that good technical stuff). And, certain people take care of your site layout and other on-page goodies like SEO.</p>



<p>You get the picture. Everybody from a single developer to a single designer in a web design agency plays a vital role that (hopefully) results in a quality website.</p>



<p>Have you noticed your site failing to match your expectations? It’s a sign that whoever is on top doesn’t have a handle on your project. Also, poor communication is a sign that your account or project isn’t getting the bandwidth it deserves and you want to make sure you get all the tools your website provider could give you!</p>



<h3>4. “Changing of the Guard”</h3>



<p>If you’ve been with your web agency for a while, you’ll have been used to how it operates. You&#8217;re familiarity with the agency will have led to ties. And, the formed business relationships can contribute to your web design projects being done with ease and quality.</p>



<p>But, what if there’s a change in management? Granted, changes can be positive. Be that as it may, firms that undergo management shifts often experience transition periods.</p>



<p>Now, transition periods aren’t necessarily bad. Then again, can you really expect the same company to deliver the same results during this period?</p>



<p>As a site owner, you would be better off assuming that it won’t. Nor will your relationship be 100% consistent with what you’ve been accustomed to.</p>



<p>In short, while a change in management isn’t in itself good or bad, it may be a sign that you need to switch agencies.</p>



<h2>Addressing Your Concerns With Your Agency</h2>



<p>Even if things are heading South with your web agency, abruptly cutting ties is not a good idea. That said, before ending things with your web agency, it may be worth having a chat over your concerns.</p>



<p>Patching things up — whether it’s your relationship or your site — beats going through the hassle of an agency switch. If you’ve noticed any of the red flags in the earlier section, the talk would be an opportunity to bring them up.</p>



<p>If your web agency is sincere about upping its efforts, it will listen to your concerns. And, the agency will take your feedback seriously, using your input to improve all aspects of your site’s build.</p>



<p>For results, give your agency about 72 hours. Of course, you can agree on a time with your agency and check changes at the agreed-upon time.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if you see no effort made to improve your site as agreed, it may be time to begin the agency switching process.</p>



<p>Switching web design agencies is a process you need to handle with care. Parting ways on a sour note can lead to problems with your site and your access to it.</p>



<p>So, how do you safely make the switch? Here’s how!</p>



<h2>Prepping for Your Breakup With Your Web Design Agency</h2>



<p>So, now you’ve made up your mind to switch web design agencies. Here are the ways to change web design agencies without all the hassles and risks that come with abrupt switches.</p>



<p>We begin with a step you may have already considered — both with a new agency or in dating:</p>



<h3>1. Start Looking for Someone New</h3>



<p>Before switching agencies, you want to make sure you have options once the sunsetting process finishes. For this reason, you need to have a list of web design agencies you can go with once you’ve terminated your contract with your provider.</p>



<p>The challenge of seeking new agencies is the review process. By review, we mean establishing early if the agency will be a right fit for your goals and your site’s objectives.</p>



<p>There are two ways you can go about this. Both are equally effective. You can do any or all of the following when shopping around:</p>



<p>Ask for referrals: This is where your professional network comes in. Consult with your network and ask if they’ve had any experiences with other web design agencies. List agencies your network gives favorable accounts of, and consider accordingly.</p>



<p>Reference 3rd-Party Review Sites: Clutch and Design Rush are your best friends here. These are industry websites that provide online reviews that rate and rank web design firms on their success. The lists on these sites are an absolute goldmine of a database for web design agencies worth your time, attention, and marketing budget.</p>



<h3>2. Get Access to All Digital Properties</h3>



<p>Your digital properties are the items that grant you access to your site. Any web agency worth its salt needs to provide these to you with no hesitation. After all, it’s your site.</p>



<p>You need to get access to at least:</p>



<ul><li>Your site’s web hosting service</li><li>Domain registration</li><li>The CMS platform your site was built with (e.g., WordPress, Wix, Canva, Joomla, Drupal)</li><li>Plugins or extensions that require sign in details (e.g., Divi if the site was built using WordPress)</li><li>FTP</li><li>Social media links or associated accounts</li><li>Email addresses</li><li>Access to Google Adwords. Google Analytics, and Google Search Console</li><li>SEO tools or extensions like Yoast or SEMRush</li></ul>



<p>Gathering all of these will allow you to perform the next step:</p>



<h3>3. Make Backups</h3>



<p>Using your access to the front and back end of your site, you can begin making backups. You can do this yourself, of course. However, if you’ve already found a web design agency, you can allow them to create site backups.</p>



<h2>Having “The Talk”</h2>



<p>Preparing to switch agencies is a crucial step. But, it’s only step one.</p>



<p>Nobody likes getting ghosted. So, if you’re to handle the sunsetting process with class and care, you’ll have to have “the talk” with your web design agency.</p>



<p>Like breaking up with who used to be your better half, try to do this in person. Of course, if quarantine restrictions are still up as you’re reading this, you can do this on a video call.</p>



<p>You should bring up why you’re terminating their services and cap things off with a handshake and best wishes.</p>



<p>Once you’ve gotten the necessary pleasantries out of the way, you can now bring up the transition date.</p>



<h2>Setting Up the Transition Date</h2>



<p>This step is a must for the proper handover to be done. Setting a specific date when the change over should be happening will allow your old team to ramp down and the new team to ramp up.</p>



<p>It would also be best practice to get the old team to provide any written technical documentation they can. Things to focus on would be:</p>



<ul><li>Key dependencies of the current website</li><li>Instructions on how to manage any custom modules/code</li><li>Instructions on how to manage non-obvious content on the site</li><li>Content Management System or plugins used and whether or not these incur periodical costs</li></ul>



<p>A clear transition date will also allow both parties (you and your web design agency) to give their respective teams a heads up. This reduces any confusion that might occur in regard to workflow.</p>



<p>By the date of transition, no accessibility should remain with your old web design agency. All should be in your possession. And, of course, your new web design agency should have exclusive access.</p>



<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>



<p>Parting ways with your web design agency is very much like a break up in more ways than one — it’s never easy. It comes with a lot of uncertainty. And, feelings are bound to be hurt.</p>



<p>By managing the severing of ties, you’ll be making life easier for yourself and your web design agency. Do so with the utmost sense of decency and professionalism and you can prevent risks and losses to your website.</p>

<p>Websites are typically a considerable investment of time and money for most organizations. To make sure you&#8217;re making the most of both, you want to at least be average, right?</p>



<span id="more-29682"></span>



<p>Well then, that begs the question — what is the average lifespan of a website?</p>



<p>For the purpose of this article, when we say &#8216;average website lifespan,&#8217; we&#8217;re effectively referring to the average time a website remains mostly unchanged before undergoing a complete website redesign.</p>



<p>We decided to take a fresh look at the topic with more up-to-date information focused on small businesses that are the most successful. This article is the culmination of our research.</p>



<h2>What Is the Overall Average Website Lifespan?</h2>



<p>For our dataset, we choose to review the top 500 websites from this year&#8217;s <a href="https://www.inc.com/inc5000/2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">INC 5000</a>, along with several dozen of our client websites with the <a href="https://archive.org/web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wayback Machine</a>.</p>



<p>We examined the design and layout of each site over a specific period and calculated the time between significant website redesigns.</p>



<p>What did we discover?</p>



<p>The overall average lifespan of a website has been shortened to 2 years and 4 months (11% less than previously benchmarked by older studies).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="600" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Overall-Average-Image.jpg" alt="Overall Average Image" class="wp-image-30256" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Overall-Average-Image.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Overall-Average-Image-300x176.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Overall-Average-Image-768x450.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Overall-Average-Image-24x14.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Overall-Average-Image-36x21.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Overall-Average-Image-48x28.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>What Is the Lifespan of Websites per Industry?</h2>



<p>As mentioned, our research involved observing the top 100 websites on the INC 5000 list and a few dozen of our own clients to determine the life expectancy of websites by industry. Here&#8217;s what we found:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="895" height="1024" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Industry-Bar-Chart-895x1024.jpg" alt="Industry Bar Chart" class="wp-image-30257" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Industry-Bar-Chart-895x1024.jpg 895w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Industry-Bar-Chart-262x300.jpg 262w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Industry-Bar-Chart-768x878.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Industry-Bar-Chart-1343x1536.jpg 1343w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Industry-Bar-Chart-1791x2048.jpg 1791w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Industry-Bar-Chart-21x24.jpg 21w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Industry-Bar-Chart-31x36.jpg 31w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Industry-Bar-Chart-42x48.jpg 42w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Industry-Bar-Chart.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 895px) 100vw, 895px" /></figure>



<ul><li><strong>Agencies:</strong> 1 year, 8 months</li><li><strong>Beauty:</strong> 1 year, 7 months</li><li><strong>Construction:</strong> 5 years, 5 months</li><li><strong>Consumer products &amp; services:</strong> 2 years, 8 months</li><li><strong>Corporate:</strong> 3 years, 6 months</li><li><strong>Education:</strong> 4 years, 6 months</li><li><strong>Energy:</strong> 3 years, 7 months</li><li><strong>Financial:</strong> 2 years, 2 months</li><li><strong>Food &amp; beverage:</strong> 1 year, 2 months</li><li><strong>Health:</strong> 2 years, 1 month</li><li><strong>Industrial &amp; manufacturing:</strong> 3 years, 3 months</li><li><strong>Media &amp; publishing:</strong> 2 years, 1 month</li><li><strong>Non-profit:</strong> 2 years, 3 months</li><li><strong>Real estate:</strong> 2 years</li><li><strong>Retail:</strong> 2 years, 4 months</li><li><strong>SaaS:</strong> 2 years, 2 months</li><li><strong>Technology/IT:</strong> 1 year, 9 months</li><li><strong>Travel &amp; Hospitality:</strong> 2 years, 6 months</li><li><strong>Sites by Huemor:</strong> 4 years, 6 months</li></ul>



<p>This data indicates that beauty brands, on average, appear to redesign their website most frequently, while construction companies redesign their websites least frequently.</p>



<p>We were also blown away to discover that websites built by us on average outperform the average lifespan by <span style="font-weight: bold;">more than 60%</span>.</p>

<h2>What Typically Prompts the Need for a Website Redesign?</h2>



<p>These are the primary factors that decide whether your website life cycle has completed its course and needs a redesign. Some of them have something to do with changes in your company, while others are concerned with developments in the web and industry.</p>



<h3>Competitors and Industry</h3>



<p>Over time, your competitors will innovate their websites with various improvements and communication to your company&#8217;s consumers. To stay competitive, you need to do the same.</p>



<p>If you haven&#8217;t looked at your competitors&#8217; websites yet, now is an excellent time to start. You should adapt as the industry evolves to avoid becoming obsolete. Your website will be compared to those of your competitors by prospective consumers. As a result, you need to make sure that your website meets their expectations.</p>



<p>Some expectations can include making your site more modern and your SEO ranking better than other competitor sites.</p>



<h3>Growing Business</h3>



<p>As a business grows often, so does its site. You can add to an existing website to an extent, but there&#8217;s an upper limit to that. If your company has expanded its service or product line dramatically or shifted focus, it may be time for a redesign.</p>



<p>In recent years, the number of firms that switched from B2B (business to business) to B2C (business to customer) has increased dramatically. This kind of transition demands significant changes not only to your website but also to your entire digital marketing strategy.</p>



<p>Your company&#8217;s website serves as its virtual front door. It introduces you to prospective consumers and expresses how you can assist them. It articulates to visitors that your company exists to help them rather than your competition.</p>



<h3>Technical Limitations</h3>



<p>Minor, incremental technological improvements can help any business or website remain relevant, such as replacing a logo with a higher-resolution image. However, over the past five years, developments such as the transition to mobile internet use have made complete website redesigns necessary for most companies. Businesses need to design their website to be mobile friendly since the current trend consumers are interested in is in a mobile format.</p>



<p>It could be that your company has new third-party software that needs to be seamlessly integrated, or it could be that the website simply doesn&#8217;t allow your staff to manage it correctly. Whatever the reason, technology has limited you, and you need a change. Users will leave websites that take too long to load or are poorly arranged.</p>



<h3>Poor Planning</h3>



<p>If the website redesign plan has initially been mismanaged, you might find yourself needing a change sooner rather than later.</p>



<p>The most common reason for a website redesign&#8217;s failure is a lack of planning. Regardless of the size of your business or industry, it&#8217;s essential that you address your website redesign strategically. Know what doesn&#8217;t work, what does, and what you want to accomplish.</p>

It gives you everything you need to know about properly planning your website redesign.</p><div class="huemorProtip-button"></div></div>



<h2>How To Extend the Lifespan of Your Website</h2>



<p>There are techniques for refreshing the appearance of your website by months or even years. Here are some tips for slowing down the aging process:</p>



<h3>Adding and Subtracting Information</h3>



<p>Visitors go to your website with the intent of completing a task or achieving a specific objective. Your website will need to be updated to accommodate changes in your company, rivals, industry, and user expectations as they arise.</p>



<p>Adding new information that is relevant or subtracting information that no longer promotes your company is one way to achieve this. You wouldn&#8217;t want visitors to discover content on your site that is no longer valid. Therefore it&#8217;s critical to keep your information up to date. Furthermore, maintaining your site will show Google that it is still active and will increase your visibility among users.</p>



<div class="huemorProtip-container" style="background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><h2 class="huemorProtip-title" style="color:black">Protip</h2><p style="color:black" class="huemorProtip-description">A great way of updating your current website is to clean up the design as well as the creative on the site. Through content management consumers will be able to find the content that matters to them as well as help to answer any questions they have about your company.</p><div class="huemorProtip-button"></div></div>



<h3>Redesign the Front Page</h3>



<p>Redesign the very first page that users view. You have to start somewhere after all! Your prospective customer should be able to visit your front page and instantly understand what you do and whether they are a good match for your brand.</p>



<p>Add new photos that update the webpage and delete unnecessary images, graphics, and the like. Removing clutter from the first page makes a positive first impression on new and returning users. However, this is only a temporary solution since significant changes might throw the front page out of sync with the rest of your site.</p>



<h3>Edit the Copy</h3>



<p>Edit current copy on the website to take out unnecessary words or information. Update copy to reflect the current state of your company.</p>



<p>If a visitor arrives at your site as a result of a search, you must persuade them that your service or product is the most ideal option for them at the moment. Make sure your web copy is up to date to show that what you offer is relevant to their current demands.</p>



<p>Actively monitoring and adjusting your website copy, as well as adding new content, will not only earn you the loyalty and confidence of your visitors but will also help you rank well in Google.</p>



<h3>Create New Assets</h3>



<p>New photography or video can go a long way. Re-shooting products, people, or producing a new company video could add new life to your existing website without requiring you to re-do the templates. Introducing new content, images, or videos can refresh a site&#8217;s look. It&#8217;s a sensible move since these elements can be reused in the future <a href="/blog/how-to-know-its-time-for-a-website-revamp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website revamp</a>.</p>



<h3>Conversion Optimization</h3>



<p>If you feel like everything is where it needs to be structurally, but sales or leads have slumped, consider conversion optimization services. These measured tests will focus on areas of the site with a strategic approach for improving conversion rates.</p>



<p>Conversion optimization helps increase the volume of highly qualified leads you acquire, boost revenue, cut acquisition expenses, get more value from your existing prospects and customers, and expand. Conversions can occur on your homepage, landing pages, blog, pricing page, and other areas of your website. Optimizing each area will help maximize the chances of turning visitors into paying customers.</p>

<h3>Update Your Website Navigation</h3>



<p>Adding key pages or removing clutter from your navigation can really transform the user journey for your website. Depending on your CMS, this can be relatively easy to do.</p>



<p>Simplify the navigation by deleting the links that get the fewest number of clicks. A well-organized and clear navigation system serves as a guide for visitors to your site&#8217;s numerous pages and content. It is essential to persuade visitors to stay, consume your content, and have a great user experience, resulting in increased revenue and brand loyalty for your company.</p>



<h2>How To Prolong Your Website&#8217;s Lifespan by 2+ Years</h2>



<p>Even if a business website is well-designed, it will need to be updated to remain a successful marketing tool. Updating your website and impressing your visitors while garnering renewed interest in your content is easier if you do it sooner rather than later.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As a marketing manager, you’re in a position where you need to deliver results. As you take on one marketing campaign after another, you will likely have relied on one party to help your business — your marketing agency.</p>



<span id="more-29684"></span>



<p>For a while now, you may have had one on your payroll. Delivering the results you want, your marketing company may have amazed and impressed you and your team — at least, early on.</p>



<p>Lately, you’ve noticed a few red flags, like inconsistent results and some serious nickel-and-diming. You may be inclined to ignore these signs, giving the marketing company the benefit of the doubt. However, sometimes, it’s just time to rip off the band-aid and sever ties.</p>



<p>Nothing good lasts forever. If this is true, then something that’s going bad shouldn’t be allowed to go on at all. It’s said that client-agency relationships are ending faster than ever, at an <a href="https://start.askwonder.com/insights/average-new-business-pitch-cost-branding-advertising-agency-last-year-average-xle0orqh1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average of 3.2 years</a>. Notice any red flags, and it may be high time for an agency overhaul.</p>



<p>Reading this, you’re probably wondering if you should change marketing agencies. So, should you?</p>



<p>Here are seven signs that you should start sunsetting your services with your current marketing agency!</p>



<h2>When To Change Your Marketing Agency: The 7 Signs</h2>



<p>Telling your marketing company that you’ll be terminating your contract with them can feel awkward.</p>



<p>Indeed, sunsetting a service with an agency you’ve built rapport with can be an uncomfortable experience.</p>



<p>But, let’s face it. You hired for results.</p>



<p>Between hiring your agency and getting those results, things need to be in order. If your agency is disappointing your business in more ways than one, you’re better off with a different agency.</p>



<p>How do you tell if it’s time for a change?</p>



<h3>1. Poor Communication</h3>



<p>It may sound cliche, but communication is the foundation of any relationship — whether it’s a romantic or business relationship.</p>



<p>Nowhere is this truer than in your relationship with your marketing company. Usually, many of the problems you have with requirements and deadlines have communication as the limiting factor.</p>



<p>Sure, the occasional report getting lost in the mail or interweb need not be a deal-breaker.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, when instructions and content briefs start getting lost in translation regularly, you’ll have to rethink your choice.</p>



<p>Consider getting the frequent cold shoulder another red flag to change marketing agencies. You can count excruciatingly late responses that drag beyond the 48-hour window as warning signs as well.</p>



<p>The bottom line is this:</p>



<p>An agency worth its salt should be easy to get in touch with for any concern or subject matter. To achieve this, your agency must keep the lines of communication open.</p>



<p>Anything less is a sign to ditch your current marketing company.</p>



<h3>2. Difficulties With Collaboration</h3>



<p>Think of your marketing campaign as a carriage. You and your marketing company are the two horses pulling the carriage forward. If you and your agency are on the same foot and are clear about what needs to be done, guess what happens?</p>



<p>The carriage goes forward and farther.</p>



<p>Now, let’s envision a different scenario. Imagine what takes place when you think your marketing strategy should go in one direction (and it should go your way), and your agency thinks otherwise.</p>



<p>That’s right. Your marketing campaign either stays where it is or ends up in a ditch.</p>



<p>Collaboration begins with being clear on goals and responsibilities. You and your marketing company need to have clear ideas about what you want out of the marketing project. From here, both of you need to know who is responsible for what.</p>



<p>Then, and only then, can you expect results. However, if your marketing company doesn’t share your vision nor does what needs to be done, it may be time to leave the other horse in the stable.</p>



<h3>3. Unreliability</h3>



<p>When you hire an agency, you’re paying for several things. You’re paying your hard-earned money for the tools they’ll use, their staff, and their expertise. Other than those things mentioned, you’re also paying for their ability to deliver results consistently and on time.</p>



<p>Reliability is something you cannot put a price on. An agency that proves to you time and time again that it can deliver on time is worth keeping. The presence of reliability is crucial. It is established as soon as you sign a contract and make your first payment.</p>



<p>There are two indicators for unreliability. One is the inability to deliver results on time. Punctuality is something you can establish from the get-go. An agency that blows the first impression and turns in reports late is a clear red flag.</p>



<p>Another sign of unreliability is inconsistent results. Sure, nothing will be on par with your expectations 100% of the time. However, when there are dramatic dips in performance, you should be concerned.</p>



<p>If an agency does not keep up with your requirements and deadlines regularly, it’s a sign that you cannot trust it. In short, it is an unreliable agency — one you’re well within your rights to change.</p>



<h3>4. The Agency Remains Deaf to Your Input</h3>



<p>Indeed, when it comes to marketing, nobody is supposed to wear the hat of an expert other than your agency. However, there is a caveat to this.</p>



<p>In truth, nobody knows what you want better than you. Your marketing company should go into business with you understanding this. Brilliant as an agency’s ideas may be, it should work with you and not against you.</p>



<p>Turning a deaf ear to what you need to say not only brings about communication problems but also allows collaboration to take a hit. More importantly, allow your agency free reign of your campaign, and you might end up with marketing that tells their story — not yours.</p>



<h3>5. Lack of Transparency</h3>



<p>Are you dealing with an agency that uses more passwords than the Pentagon? Do you find yourself having to ask for login details to tools on a near-daily basis? If you’ve answered “yes” to both, then you’re dealing with an agency that’s not being transparent with you.</p>



<p>Transparency can put a huge dent in your trust. The marred trust can carry over negatively to how you communicate and collaborate. So, if you see any sign that your agency isn’t shooting straight with you, move on to a better one.</p>



<p>What should you look out for? Other than a password-protected way of doing things, watch out for:</p>



<ul><li>The agency refuses to fully explain their strategy</li><li>The agency does not divulge to you who’s working on the project from their side</li><li>Adds charges to an invoice without specifying the reason</li><li>Adding extra items to the invoice you need to pay without letting you know ahead of time or consulting with you</li></ul>



<h3>6. No Accountability</h3>



<p>Nobody wants to work with a person who’s an Olympic-level athlete in playing the blame game. A lack of accountability appears as a refusal to own up to mistakes or errors — albeit unintentional.</p>



<p>Granted, when a strategy fails, nobody is without fault. But, when the agency doesn’t acknowledge what it could have done better, you need to rethink your relationship.</p>



<p>A marketing company that lacks accountability will attribute the shortcomings of a marketing campaign to everybody but its employees and management. In most cases, they will point to your “lack of clarification” or your “delayed payment.”</p>



<h3>7. The Results Just Don’t Show</h3>



<p>Ultimately, why does any marketing manager hire a marketing agency? Management hires agencies for results.</p>



<p>If results just aren’t there within the agreed-upon time frame, the agency may not be up to the task. It’s that simple.</p>



<p>If this is the case, politely inform your agency that you’ll be going with a new agency that will bring results.</p>



<h2>When To Give Your Marketing Agency a Second Chance</h2>



<p>We’ve gone over when to change marketing agencies. But, is it possible to give yours a second chance? The answer is, “yes!”</p>



<p>Here are the few instances where you need to reconsider sunsetting your marketing agency:</p>



<h3>1. Extenuating Circumstances</h3>



<p>Through no fault of anybody, setbacks occur. A hiccup can be the product of force majeure or something like 2020.</p>



<p>Sometimes, you need to acknowledge that life gets in the way of your marketing aspirations. When it does, your agency is not to blame. Hence, you may want to keep your agency on board, especially if circumstances are not within anyone’s control.</p>



<h3>2. Isolated Incident</h3>



<p>Recurrent problems are clear signs of when to change marketing agencies. On the other hand, mishaps that are few and far between may be tolerable.</p>



<p>A positive track record with an agency should put any minor errors in perspective. Hence, you may want to think about severing ties over a single screw-up.</p>



<h3>3. The Problems Are Due to One Employee</h3>



<p>A marketing agency may be the sum of its parts. But, sometimes, you’ll be dealing with one specific employee from the team. When issues surface due to this employee, you can either cut ties with the company altogether or you can just bring it to the agency&#8217;s management.</p>



<p>The latter is a better alternative, especially if you’ve had a positive experience with the agency already. After all, hardly can one employee be a reflection of an agency’s performance.</p>



<h2>Know When To Change Marketing Agencies</h2>



<p>When you’re thinking of changing marketing agencies, all you need to do is keep an eye out for red flags. These red flags will indicate problems in your relationship and the agency’s performance.</p>



<p>Once you’ve confirmed the presence of problems in your relationship with your marketing agency, it’s time to end the relationship. Do this, and your marketing campaign will be in better hands with the next marketing agency you choose. Your perfectly optimized content goes here!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you&#8217;re reading this you&#8217;re likely a marketing professional who&#8217;s in charge of generating demand for your business.</p>



<p>You have challenging KPI&#8217;s to meet, limited resources, and limited time to get you there. You also, most likely, don&#8217;t have a website that&#8217;s up to the challenges you&#8217;re about to face.</p>



<p>Just having a website is not enough these days. It needs to be functional, responsive, SEO optimized, connect with your customers, and have a design that stands out.</p>



<p>You know that – but do your bosses?</p>



<p>How do you convince leadership that web design services can help with rebranding and getting a better foothold in the market?</p>



<span id="more-29694"></span>



<div class="hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed" style="width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 480px; max-height: 480px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;">
<div class="hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 100.00%; margin: 0;"><iframe class="giphy-embed hs-responsive-embed-iframe" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;" src="https://giphy.com/embed/FcuiZUneg1YRAu1lH2" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-service="giphy" width="480" height="480" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
</div>



<p>For this, there are several key elements. First, you need to look at things from management&#8217;s perspective to understand why they may oppose such an idea of a website redesign.</p>



<p>From there, have a clear grasp of the value the new website could offer and use this insight to address the concerns of the website redesign process that leadership may have.</p>



<p>In this article we&#8217;ll be outlining a few different ways you can approach this conversation with your leadership team and how to create a compelling case for a new website.</p>



<p>Ready to dive in? Awesome, keep reading.</p>



<div class="ChapterFullwidth" style="background-image:url(https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-form">
<a id="chapter 1"></a>
</div><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">Chapter 1</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">Leadership Pain Points</h2></div></div>



<p>Ultimately, the primary function of leadership is to ensure that all the resources are put to good use to generate maximum value. This includes staff, finances, assets, and even your website.</p>



<p>Whereas they may not be entirely against website redesign, they are likely not to view it as a necessity. This is primarily because they do not fully appreciate the value a website has to offer and the challenges that such a project may present.</p>



<p>This is where your insight and effort come in.</p>



<h3>Some of the pain points leadership may have that you should address include:</h3>



<ul><li>Not having enough staff or know-how to handle a website redesign</li><li>They may deem other projects to be of greater priority over a website redesign</li><li>Having a small budget outside core business activities</li><li>The cost of keeping a website up to date</li></ul>



<div class="ChapterFullwidth" style="background-image:url(https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-form">
<a id="chapter 2"></a>
</div><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">Chapter 2</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">Why You Need to Get Your Boss to Agree to a Website Redesign</h2></div></div>



<p>In a digital world, the best place to get your customers is online. Being the heart of your online presence, a subpar website will not only be ineffective but detrimental to your efforts.</p>



<h3>1. It&#8217;s an Inevitable Cost</h3>



<p>When it comes to web design services, it is not a question of if you need them but when you&#8217;ll use them. Your current website may perform optimally today, but it will eventually become outdated and require a website redesign.</p>



<p>On average, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2021/03/01/your-websites-life-span-may-be-shorter-than-you-think/?sh=13195877e85c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the lifespan of a website is two years and seven months</a>. So, if your existing website has been active for a few years, an upgrade may be well overdue.</p>



<p>Given that you will eventually incur website redesign costs, it&#8217;s better to do it as soon as possible.</p>



<h4>This will allow you to:</h4>



<ul><li>Reduce the detrimental impact to brand perception of a non-performing website</li><li>Capitalize on the benefits of an upgraded website early on</li></ul>



<p>Once leadership realizes that website redesign is an inevitable cost, they&#8217;ll be more open to it, especially once they realize the value it can offer.</p>



<h3>2. Return on Investment (ROI)</h3>



<p>For your boss, it&#8217;s not just about what they&#8217;ll agree to spend but what the business will get in return, whether it will be an expense or an investment. So, as you <a href="/blog/website-redesign" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plan for website redesign</a>, think in terms of ROI.</p>



<p>As such, what you pitch should not just be a new look website but one that comes with new features and a content management strategy. In terms of generating income, the website will serve as a vehicle and content as the fuel that gets you moving.</p>



<p>Aside from the revenues you generate, there are other ways that you can accurately determine the performance and ROI of your website.</p>



<h4>i) Website Traffic</h4>



<p>The goal of having a website is to have a way for prospects to reach you easily online. Once they do, you can slowly nurture them into loyal customers from whom you can draw lifetime value.</p>



<p>Considering that the <a href="https://www.invespcro.com/blog/the-average-website-conversion-rate-by-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average conversion rate of a website is 4.31%</a>, your website needs good search engine rankings to attract a significant number of visitors for it to be a reliable source of leads.<br>If your website&#8217;s traffic has been reducing over the last year, you can be sure its ROI has gone down significantly.</p>



<p>Redesigning your website and accompanying it with a robust content strategy can increase traffic to higher levels than before, thus improving the ROI.</p>



<h4>ii) Conversion Rates</h4>



<p>Another key website metric to track is user conversion rate. It represents the number of website visitors that complete a desired goal, which is, in most cases, making a purchase.</p>



<p>Although average website conversion rates may be low, it varies significantly across different sectors and also within them, depending on several factors. Many factors can cause your website conversion rates to dip. In most cases, it comes as a result of reducing web traffic.</p>



<p>However, that&#8217;s not always the case. At times, you may have a relatively consistent flow of website traffic on a current site, but conversion rates will still go down. This is a clear indication that something within the website is causing this.</p>



<h4>Such factors may include:</h4>



<ul><li>Website pages take too long to load</li><li>Poor website navigation</li></ul>



<h4>iii) Bounce rate</h4>



<p>One of the best signs of a healthy website, which includes design and management, is high engagement levels. Even if not all website visitors convert, others will take different actions such as clicking links, loading other pages, or filling out forms.</p>



<p>However, if your site does not meet user experience expectations regarding website performance, your bounce rate will increase. Essentially, this means that they will not spend enough time on your current website to take meaningful actions. As a result, your ROI will also continue going down as the bounce rate on your website increases.</p>



<div class="ChapterFullwidth" style="background-image:url(https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-form">
<a id="chapter 3"></a>
</div><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">Chapter 3</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">Reasons for Redesigning Your Website</h2></div></div>



<p>With each investment, organizations want a return on investment. Undoubtedly, the costs of <a href="https://huemor.rocks/case-studies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web design services</a> and website management are high. As such, the ROI of getting a new site should be proportionally high. Therefore, when championing a website redesign for your company, your biggest task is to demonstrate that the value it offers justifies the investment.</p>



<p>Some of the reasons to consider a redesign include:</p>



<h3>1. Industry Trends</h3>



<p>If you want to thrive in today&#8217;s competitive business ecosystem, you have to keep an eye on competitors. What they do in terms of product development and marketing, will have a significant effect on your results.</p>



<p>As such, you should keep tabs on their website as it plays a key role in marketing and branding.</p>



<h4>By monitoring your competitors&#8217; websites, you can identify the areas where you are lagging behind.<br>Some of the things you should be keen on include:</h4>



<ul><li>Web design</li><li>User experience</li><li>Content strategy</li><li>Imagery</li><li>Overall branding</li></ul>



<p>With this in mind, it&#8217;s best to ensure that your website sets the bar in your industry. Ensure that your communication is clear, the copy is captivating, and that you use high-resolution images.</p>



<p>In doing so, it positions your website and brand as an industry leader, thus increasing traffic, conversion rates, and, more importantly, ROI.</p>



<h3>2. It&#8217;s a Mobile Era</h3>



<p>When it comes to internet usage, one can be forgiven to associate it with computer use as the two were almost synonymous at some point.</p>



<p>However, things have changed as <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/779/mobile-internet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">90% of the global internet population</a> use mobile devices to access the internet.</p>



<p>Initially, during website design, the target audience was computer users. When users try to access such websites using mobile devices, they encounter challenges such as slowness and obstructed views.</p>



<p>So, unless you want to lock out a sizable and growing proportion of prospects from accessing your products, a website upgrade may be due to ensure it&#8217;s mobile devices-friendly.</p>



<h3>3. Usability</h3>



<p>There&#8217;s no need of having a website, if it&#8217;s not usable, as it will cause more harm than good.<br>As consumers become accustomed to better website user experiences, it is now a bare minimum. If your website disappoints them in terms of performance, they will transfer such sentiments to your products and brand as a whole.</p>



<p>Usability simply means that the focus of website design and development is the user and is done from their perspective. If your website is lacking in this, a facelift may be what it needs for it to give you meaningful results.</p>



<h4>Some of the gains that come with improving usability include:</h4>



<ul><li>The website becomes more responsive</li><li>Improved server uptime</li><li>Few to no broken links</li></ul>



<p>A key element of improving usability is <a href="/blog/our-secret-to-ada-site-compliance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adhering to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a>. These define how individuals with different needs and abilities can use your website. Moreover, it also helps with SEO, branding, and increasing revenue.</p>



<div class="ChapterFullwidth" style="background-image:url(https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-form">
<a id="chapter 4"></a>
</div><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">Chapter 4</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">What to do in the Meantime</h2></div></div>



<p>At this point, you should <a href="/blog/how-to-know-its-time-for-a-website-revamp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">know whether it&#8217;s time to revamp your website</a>. But before you rush into your boss&#8217; office, you should prepare for pitching the website redesign process.</p>



<h3>Create an analysis of your Current Website</h3>



<p>For leadership to buy into the idea that a website upgrade is necessary, you must demonstrate that it&#8217;s performing below par. So, the first thing you should do is perform website analysis.</p>



<p>You can begin by assessing the content on the website, spanning from articles, bio pages, images, and product descriptions. Then, identify areas that need some fine-tuning and do not require a lot of resources.</p>



<p>From there, do a deep dive and go into the world of analytics.</p>



<h4>Some of the key metrics you should analyze include:</h4>



<ul><li>Traffic &#8211; How many visitors do you have, and how has the figure changed over time?</li><li>Bounce rate &#8211; How many users exit the website without interacting with it?</li><li>Average page views per session &#8211; Do visitors explore your website for more information or to view products, or just leave at the first page?</li><li>Session duration &#8211; How much time do users spend on your website, and how has it been changing over time?</li></ul>



<h3>Do Research</h3>



<p>After performing website analysis, you&#8217;ll gain crucial insight into your website&#8217;s performance and how it has been changing. However, don&#8217;t stop at that.</p>



<p>Go the extra mile and research the performance of your direct and indirect competitors and their website. This will also guide you on what you need to do to catch up with the best performers in your industry.</p>



<p>Beyond this, go to the people who use your existing website (consumers, prospects, and target audience) and inquire about their experience and the type of improvements they&#8217;d like to see. If their user experience sentiments echo the results from analytics, you&#8217;ll have enough to convince your boss you need a redesign.</p>



<h3>Bring the Point Home to Leadership and Next Steps</h3>



<p>In preparation for your pitch the redesign process to leadership, there are some key steps you should take to help strengthen it.</p>



<h4>These include:</h4>



<ul><li>Understanding leadership&#8217;s objectives- Whereas it may be difficult to know what leadership is focusing on, finding out can be beneficial. If you can demonstrate how upgrading the website will strengthen their cause, they&#8217;ll be more receptive.</li><li>Get support for your proposal- The more employees who share your ideas, the better it will appear, more so if it is someone influential in the company.</li></ul>



<p>Once you have the support you need, discuss with them the potential limitations and challenges of the redesign process. This will enable you to negotiate a compromise with leadership, should the proposal at its whole be out of reach at this moment.</p>



<h3>Create a Well Thought Out Analysis</h3>



<p>As you approach leadership with the new website proposal, do not just present raw data. Instead, take the time to interpret it and craft a well-thought-out analysis. It should demonstrate how website performance, including things like how search engine rankings and user experience have been waning and link it to changes in revenue if possible.</p>



<p>Since human beings are largely visual creatures, create graphs and charts representing the data you collect. This will make it easier for the leadership team to understand and interpret the redesign process, thus increasing your chances of success in convincing them they need a website redesign.</p>



<p>Moreover, you should highlight key areas of improvement, the resources necessary, and the results to expect within a given timeline for the website redesign process.</p>



<div class="ChapterFullwidth" style="background-image:url(https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-form">
<a id="chapter 5"></a>
</div><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">Chapter 5</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">Don&#8217;t Settle for Less. Do you need a Website Redesign?</h2></div></div>



<p>It&#8217;s one thing to redesign your website, and it&#8217;s another thing entirely to get it where it needs to be for you to realize tangible results. Equally important to redesigning your website is the web designer company you choose.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In an ideal world, your users don&#8217;t even notice your website navigation. They use it to quickly get where they need to go, flowing through your site and to your conversion points in the exact paths you&#8217;ve mapped for them.</p>



<span id="more-29698"></span>



<p>Unfortunately, too often, that ideal world doesn&#8217;t reflect reality. Navigation in web design becomes a sticking point that frustrates your users and hurts your conversions.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s not an uncommon problem, either; even the best web pages have some friction points in their site&#8217;s navigation.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s time to do something about that. According to one study, <a href="https://smallbiztrends.com/2019/01/easy-website-navigation-is-important.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">94% of users</a> believe your website needs to be easy to navigate. If it isn&#8217;t, <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/compelling-stats-website-design-optimization-list" target="_blank" rel="noopener">38% of visitors</a> will stop engaging with your site immediately.</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s before we even begin to talk about the role that your <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/seo-ux-main-navigation/297965/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">navigation plays in your SEO efforts</a>.</p>



<p>In other words, unassuming as it might be, your website&#8217;s navigation could actually be a major pivot point for your conversion rates and SEO efforts. If you don&#8217;t get it right, you risk a significant number of visitors dropping off a different website and failing to convert.<br>The good news: getting it right is not rocket science. You just need some basic knowledge about navigational structures, and how to avoid some of the most common mistakes made in this area. Let&#8217;s get started.</p>

<p>At its most basic, your navigation in web design has a simple purpose: to get your website visitors where they need to go, quickly and without complications or confusion.</p>



<p>Do it right, and you&#8217;ll get them on a path you want them to go. They&#8217;ll quickly get valuable information from your website and perhaps even convert to a lead or customer if they&#8217;re ready for that step.</p>



<p>To get there, most sites use one or more of these 5 types of website navigation:</p>



<h3>1. The Top Menu</h3>



<p>Most readers probably envisioned the top menu immediately upon opening this guide. It&#8217;s the most common navigation menu option out there, a simple horizontal bar listing all the main sections of a web page.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="641" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/top-menu-image.jpg" alt="top menu image" class="wp-image-30413" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/top-menu-image.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/top-menu-image-300x188.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/top-menu-image-768x481.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/top-menu-image-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/top-menu-image-36x23.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/top-menu-image-48x30.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-right">Source &#8211; <a href="https://getneuro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neuro</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Top menus are so popular because they follow the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">F-shaped pattern we use to read web pages</a>. It&#8217;s also often pinned to the top of the website browser window, staying visible even as visitors begin to scroll past the hero image and pop ups.</p>



<p>To get to more than the few sections that fit into the top navigation menu, many websites use drop-downs off the main items, which become categories. Another common option: the sidebar.</p>



<h3>2. The Sidebar</h3>



<p>Some websites have their main navigation on the left side of the page. For most, though, the sidebar is a secondary menu once you&#8217;re already in a specific category.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a bar, usually on the left but sometimes on the right of the page, that presents subcategories to visitors. For content-rich sites that post plenty of site and social media content, it&#8217;s a good way to keep filtering down the search results.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="641" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/side-nav-image.jpg" alt="side nav image" class="wp-image-30414" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/side-nav-image.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/side-nav-image-300x188.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/side-nav-image-768x481.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/side-nav-image-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/side-nav-image-36x23.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/side-nav-image-48x30.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption> Source &#8211; <a href="https://getopenspaces.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Spaces</a> </figcaption></figure>



<p>For example, after clicking on a company&#8217;s blog, you might find topic areas about related content within the blog in the sidebar.</p>



<h3>3. The Footer</h3>



<p>We&#8217;ve recently written about <a href="/blog/website-footer-design-best-practices" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best practices for website footers</a>, which are crucial website navigation options for many users. Information and links here shouldn&#8217;t duplicate what&#8217;s in your main nav, but add to it.</p>



<p>That means reserving it for the type of next steps your users might need once they reach the end of the page. Quick, easy links to conversion-rich pages within the website (and maybe even a secondary call to action) can all find their home in the footer.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="641" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/footer-image.webp" alt="footer image" class="wp-image-30415" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/footer-image.webp 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/footer-image-300x188.webp 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/footer-image-768x481.webp 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/footer-image-24x15.webp 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/footer-image-36x23.webp 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/footer-image-48x30.webp 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption> Source &#8211;<a href="https://www.prima.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Prima</a> </figcaption></figure>



<h3>4. The Breadcrumbs</h3>



<p>These crumbs are not yet another list of links. Instead, they&#8217;re an opportunity to show the path to your target audience used to get to your website.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="537" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/breadcrumbs-image.jpg" alt="breadcrumbs image" class="wp-image-30416" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/breadcrumbs-image.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/breadcrumbs-image-300x157.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/breadcrumbs-image-768x403.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/breadcrumbs-image-24x13.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/breadcrumbs-image-36x19.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/breadcrumbs-image-48x25.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption> Source &#8211; <a href="https://www.aerotech.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aerotech </a>(Check out our <a href="https://huemor.rocks/case-studies/aerotech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">case study</a>) </figcaption></figure>



<p>If your website goes deep into subcategories of subcategories, breadcrumbs become increasingly useful. They allow your audience to stay oriented with where they are, and easily go &#8216;one level up&#8217; again if they need to. It&#8217;s a navigational crutch that has the potential to enhance your user experience.</p>



<h3>5. The Hamburger Menu</h3>



<p>Finally, the rise of mobile-first web design has brought one relatively new type of website navigation into the spotlight: the hamburger menu.</p>



<p>Getting its name from a vague 2D lookalike of a patty between two buns, the hamburger menu started as an option for mobile users for whom a standard navigation would take up the entire web page. Instead, it expands only upon clicking the icon, a kind of navigation-on-demand.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="641" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hamburger-menu.jpg" alt="hamburger menu" class="wp-image-30417" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hamburger-menu.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hamburger-menu-300x188.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hamburger-menu-768x481.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hamburger-menu-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hamburger-menu-36x23.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hamburger-menu-48x30.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption> Source &#8211; <a href="https://globekit.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Globe Kit</a> </figcaption></figure>



<p>However, perhaps to save valuable screen size, hamburger menus are starting to nudge their way into the standard website navigation menu options, as well. Some UX experts are even <a href="https://usabilitygeek.com/making-case-for-desktop-hamburger-menu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">starting to recommend it</a>.</p>



<div class="ChapterFullwidth" style="background-image:url(https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-form">
<a id="chapter 2"></a>
</div><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">Chapter 2</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">7 Common Navigation Issues, and How to Fix Them</h2></div></div>



<p>Now that you&#8217;ve familiarized yourself with the most common types, let&#8217;s jump into the most common problems we tend to encounter in the wild. Don&#8217;t worry, though. We&#8217;ll also provide some best practices in website navigation that can prevent you from making the same (or similar) mistakes.</p>



<h3>Issue #1: Hidden Navigation</h3>



<p>Your website navigation is so crucial to your overall user experience that you can&#8217;t afford to hide it. <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/hamburger-menus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Research has shown</a> that hidden nav items on a site lengthen the time it takes for visitors to search for what they need, increasing frustration in the process.</p>



<p>Hidden navigation comes in more than one way. It might be in an unexpected spot on your website, or blend in too much with your web design. Or, you could hide your individual items behind web design features like a hamburger menu or a &#8220;more&#8221; button.</p>



<p>The intention of saving space might be good, and the look might be great to anyone intimately familiar with the site. But if your navigation is hidden and its individual items aren&#8217;t obvious and easy to find for new visitors, you have a problem.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/564691059?h=6624d39d63&amp;dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="500" height="335" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption> Source &#8211; <a href="https://blab.studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blab.Studio</a> </figcaption></figure>



<h4>How to Fix It: Make it Obvious</h4>



<p>Make sure the nav clearly stands out and is not hidden, and fully represents the options your users have at first glance. Some whitespace, between the navigation and the rest of the site as well as between individual nav items, also doesn&#8217;t hurt.</p>



<h3>Issue #2: Vague Navigation Labels</h3>



<p>It&#8217;s a mistake so widespread, it might as well be common practice. Navigation items are labeled products, videos, services, or something similar. In other words, your labels are how you&#8217;d name your internal folders on a hard drive, if you already knew what was in it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="641" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/vague-navigation.jpg" alt="vague navigation" class="wp-image-30418" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/vague-navigation.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/vague-navigation-300x188.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/vague-navigation-768x481.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/vague-navigation-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/vague-navigation-36x23.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/vague-navigation-48x30.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption> Source &#8211; <a href="https://forgeandsmith.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forge and Smith</a> </figcaption></figure>



<p>The problem is that your users don&#8217;t. They don&#8217;t know what services you offer, or what types of videos you&#8217;re about to show them. They&#8217;ll need to navigate around just to find out—and they won&#8217;t appreciate that extra step.</p>



<h4>How to Fix It: Make Your Labels Descriptive</h4>



<p>Ideally, every item in your navigation should say exactly what it&#8217;s about. Instead of services, list the type of service you offer. Instead of videos, highlight that they&#8217;re DIY tutorials on specific subjects.</p>



<p>As a bonus, search engines also love descriptive labels. You might even want to use keyword research to understand exactly how to label each nav item. That enhances your search engine optimization, Google Analytics, and your user experience, all at once.</p>



<h3>Issue #3: Too Many Options</h3>



<p>Who hasn&#8217;t come to a website and immediately left because the choices were just so overwhelming? It&#8217;s what psychologists describe as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/27/your-money/27shortcuts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paralyzing Problem of Too Many Choices</a>. For your website navigation, it could be an absolute killer.</p>



<p>Two reasons for that. One, too many navigational items, especially if not hierarchically sorted into subcategories, are difficult to browse through. Two, too many choices immediately from your landing page can negatively impact your <a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/page-authority" target="_blank" rel="noopener">page authority</a>.</p>



<p>Most external pages link to your homepage, which Google consequently considers to have maximum authority. That authority is mainly distributed to pages directly linked from your site homepage. The more you link to, the lower the authority of each, lowering your ranking for those pages.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/564771769?h=c90a5238a0&amp;dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="500" height="313" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption> Source &#8211; <a href="https://pittsburghpa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">City of Pittsburgh</a> </figcaption></figure>



<h4>How to Fix It: Keep Your Main Options to 7 or Less</h4>



<p>Seven seems to be a <a href="https://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Miller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">magic number here</a>. Go above, and the negative impact on your visitors confusion and domain authority begins to multiply. In your main menu bar, it&#8217;s crucial not to go above.</p>



<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean sites can only have seven total pages beyond your homepage at least; just not seven &#8216;main pages&#8217; just below your homepage. Beyond that, each should be part of an easily understandable sub-category.</p>



<h3>Issue #4: Random Nav Item Order</h3>



<p>Which items come first, and which come last? You&#8217;d be surprised how random that order can be. Some organizations love to list pricing as a priority, others last. About Us tends to go towards the end, as does a client portfolio. But sometimes, it&#8217;s services.<br>In other words, there isn&#8217;t an established best practice that everyone seems to follow. That doesn&#8217;t mean, of course, that there shouldn&#8217;t be. Once again, paying attention to your users&#8217; expectations can go a long way towards finding a fix.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="857" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/nav-order-image.jpg" alt="nav order image" class="wp-image-30419" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/nav-order-image.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/nav-order-image-300x251.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/nav-order-image-768x643.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/nav-order-image-24x20.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/nav-order-image-36x30.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/nav-order-image-48x40.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4>How to Fix It: The Serial Position Effect</h4>



<p>Another <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/primacy-recency.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">psychology concept</a> for you: when presented with a series of choices, we tend to remember those that came first and last by far the most.</p>



<p>For your site&#8217;s navigation, that means it makes sense that the spots in the middle are actually the least important. Lead your labels with the most important immediate next step (like signing up for a demo or describing your product), before ending with the most important final takeaway (like social proof or pricing).</p>



<h3>Issue #5: Confusing Drop-Down Items</h3>



<p>Drop-downs, in isolation, are often necessary—especially if you have more than seven pages on your website. But they can quickly turn from helpful to awful.</p>



<p>The last thing you want is a vague top-level label, followed by either a drop-down so small that it wasn&#8217;t even necessary, or a huge dropdown of an alphabetized list. It&#8217;s a sure sign to your audience to jump ship.</p>



<p>Search engines also don&#8217;t necessarily like drop-downs because of how difficult they are to crawl. So if you use one, you better get it right.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/564738839?h=f6af9fe382&amp;dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="500" height="313" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption> Source &#8211; <a href="https://www.yale.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yale</a> </figcaption></figure>



<h4>How to Fix It: Structure Your Drop-Downs</h4>



<p>First, take a look and make sure that your page count actually needs a drop-down. A secondary sidebar might actually be more beneficial in your scenario. If you do need one, make sure it&#8217;s structured right, with intuitive categories and no more than five links within each category.</p>



<h3>Issue #6: Navigation/Button Confusion</h3>



<p>Your website has a navigation for users to get around, and call-to-action buttons for them to convert. Some nav bars or footers even have buttons, too. But it can be fatal to confuse the two, or use one as a substitute for the other.</p>



<p>You might be tempted to use the same colors or shapes in both your buttons and your navigation. But that actually confuses your site users and can turn them away from the conversion paths you&#8217;ve built. Websites where the wayfinding and goal seeking are mixed up tend to be a mess to navigate.</p>



<h4>How to Fix It: Create a Clear Design Hierarchy</h4>



<p>It&#8217;s quite simple, actually. Your nav should look one way, and your call-to-action buttons should look another. While they can both fit into a larger branding scheme, their styles should be clearly distinguished in your design hierarchy.</p>



<p>Want to test it out? Place a button directly over your nav bar. Can you still tell that the goal here is separate and different from simple wayfinding? Makes sense, right? If so, your web design hierarchy is working, and your users become much more likely to be confused (and more likely to reach conversion rate optimization).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="641" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/button-nav-image.jpg" alt="button nav image" class="wp-image-30420" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/button-nav-image.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/button-nav-image-300x188.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/button-nav-image-768x481.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/button-nav-image-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/button-nav-image-36x23.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/button-nav-image-48x30.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption> Source &#8211; <a href="https://gleamin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gleamin</a> (Check out our <a href="https://huemor.rocks/case-studies/gleamin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">case study</a>) </figcaption></figure>



<h3>Issue #7: Mobile Unfriendliness</h3>



<p>In 2022, everything about your website needs to be optimized for mobile. Unfortunately, too many websites go 90% of the way, but fall short when it comes to their navigation.</p>



<p>The top bar might be hidden in a hamburger menu, with difficult-to-navigate dropdown sub-categories. The footer text might become too small for touch-based operation. And we haven&#8217;t even started talking about the challenges of a secondary navigation (like a sidebar) on a screen too small for it to fit.</p>



<p>So, you get to a system that&#8217;s largely mobile-unfriendly and basically non responsive for mobile. That means potentially alienating almost <a href="https://www.perficient.com/insights/research-hub/mobile-vs-desktop-usage#:~:text=Globally%2C%2068.1%25%20of%20all%20website,of%20visitors%20came%20from%20tablets." target="_blank" rel="noopener">70% of your site visitors</a>. Not a good look, and certainly not good for conversions with your target audience.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://f.hubspotusercontent00.net/hubfs/6606556/mobile-friendly-image%20(1).jpg" alt="mobile-friendly-image (1)"/></figure>



<p>Oh, and you could also get some <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/the-complete-list-of-google-penalties-and-how-to-recover/201510/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">serious SEO penalties</a>.</p>



<h4>How to Fix It: Test Your Mobile Nav System</h4>



<p>The initial solution here is actually pretty simple: navigate your own website with your own mobile device. That could give you some serious initial insights.</p>



<p>Then, get some credible third parties to review the same thing from their devices, as well. Only be satisfied when the navigation and site design works as well and is as simple on mobile devices as it does on desktop.</p>



<div class="ChapterFullwidth" style="background-image:url(https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-form">

<p>When the goal is to be as unassuming and natural as possible, it&#8217;s easy to underestimate just how important website navigation truly is for your users. But it&#8217;s issues like the above that make it clear: if you don&#8217;t get it right, you will lose valuable credibility, attention, and conversions.</p>



<p>The good news is that each of the most common issues also have relatively simple best practice fixes. Take good care of your website, and you&#8217;ll begin to create more interaction, keep your audience&#8217;s attention for longer, and drive more customers effectively towards conversions.</p>

<p>As a business, you make some decisions because they benefit your customers, while others are designed to protect your business legally. Building an ADA-compliant website falls into both categories.</p>



<span id="more-29702"></span>



<p>According to the CDC, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/infographic-disability-impacts-all.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 60 million Americans</a> live with some type of disability. That&#8217;s more than one in four adults. According to <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/disability#:~:text=Results-,One%20billion%20people%2C%20or%2015%25%20of%20the%20world's%20population%2C,million%20people%2C%20experience%20significant%20disabilities." target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Bank estimates</a>, that number rises to one billion around the world. Following relevant disability guidelines ensures that your website is as relevant and beneficial to them as it would be to any other potential customer or client.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s one incentive. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) also makes building an accessible website a legal necessity. While it doesn&#8217;t technically mention websites as part of its language, they have been deemed &#8220;places of public accommodations&#8221; under the law by a wide range of court rulings. Compliance is crucial to avoid potential lawsuits or settlements.</p>



<p>Making your web content accessible, in turn, means following WCAG, which is short for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. More specifically, <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/glance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WCAG 2.1</a> is a set of individual rules that ensure your website is accessible for users with any type of disability.</p>



<p>So let&#8217;s dive in. Keep reading to learn not just why your business needs to care about ADA and WCAG but also how you can accomplish an ADA compliant site —with one option that might be simpler than you thought.</p>

<h5 id="chapter1" style="text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: 2px; color: #ec4067;">Chapter 1:</h5>
<h2 style="color: #ffffff;">Why is ADA Compliance Important?</h2>
</div>



<p>We&#8217;ll explain the basics, but there’s always more to learn. ADA compliance has serious business benefits, not in the least because a significant portion of your users will appreciate it.</p>



<h3>What is Website compliance?</h3>



<p>First, we need to ask ourselves “What is website compliance?” Website compliance is described as “the state of observing and following all accessibility laws and regulations that apply to your website – should be an overall goal for your organization” by <a href="https://www.essentialaccessibility.com/blog/how-to-ensure-website-compliance-accessibility-standards#:~:text=Web%20compliance%20%E2%80%93%20the%20state%20of,overall%20goal%20for%20your%20organization." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Essential Accessibility.com</a>. One of these accessibility laws is Title II and Title III of the ADA which states that persons with disabilities cannot be discriminated against on the basis of their disability. By making your website and web content accessible this allows for equal access for all people.</p>



<div class="hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed" style="width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 640px; max-height: 310px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;">
<div class="hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 48.44%; margin: 0;"><iframe class="hs-responsive-embed-iframe" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/548848871?color=D41756&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="640" height="310" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-service="vimeo"></iframe></div>
</div>



<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Above is an example of our favorite ADA website compliance tool in action on our client Ag America&#8217;s website.</span></p>



<h3>Who does ADA Web Compliance Apply to?</h3>



<p>Under Title III of the ADA concerns public businesses while under Title II it specifically describes accessible websites and public accommodation. Meaning businesses must be able to serve people with disabilities by providing them access to web content in accommodating ways.</p>



<p>In terms of the World Wide Web, places of public accommodation would make businesses are responsible and to make sure their digital content follows best practices through the forms of mobile apps, webpages, any links, etc.</p>



<h3>Is ADA Compliance Mandatory for Websites?</h3>



<p>The technical answer to this question is “not necessarily” under federal, however, under local and state government there must be accessible websites. From both a legal and ethical point of view should offer web accessibility services through their websites as there are a number of benefits for doing so.<br>The best way of offering public accommodation is through following WCAG guidelines to create web accessibility for all. The success criteria will be shared later on but follow the guidelines laid out in WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1 will help to make your website accessible and avoid legal action such as lawsuits.</p>



<h3>The User Benefits of Website Compliance</h3>



<p>We&#8217;ve established already just how common disabilities actually are in the general population. Millions of people might have trouble recognizing certain colors, reading small type, or seeing any of your visual content. Others might have limited use of their hands, increasing their difficulty to navigate around your site.</p>



<p>The general term for software that helps these users navigate the web is typically called assistive technology. It can include a wide range of platforms, including:</p>



<ul><li>Screen readers</li><li>Eye tracking tools</li><li>Automatic contrast adjustments</li><li>Speech recognition software</li><li>And much more.</li></ul>



<p>Globally, this is a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200713005395/en/Global-Disabled-and-Elderly-Assistive-Technology-Industry-2020-to-2027---Market-Trajectory-Analytics---ResearchAndMarkets.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$21 billion industry</a> that is expected to top $31 billion by 2027. The rapid growth is only natural, considering how increasingly important the internet has become around the globe.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll get into the exact question of what makes an ADA accessible website below. For now, the most important takeaway is that a website following WCAG and ADA guidelines is specifically designed for all common disabilities, and the technology accommodating them. It ensures that your website is just as beneficial for them as it is for all other segments of your audience.</p>



<p>Think about the opportunities that it brings, depending on the audience you target. A retailer targeting older populations might improve the online experience of more than 50% of its audience. But even a beauty brand, whose audience might skew younger, will still encounter users with disabilities who will appreciate the accommodations.</p>



<p>In short, visitors will appreciate a user interface that accommodates their needs, rather than forcing them to adjust to yours.</p>



<h3>The Business Benefits of ADA Compliance</h3>



<p>Those user benefits above, of course, are not purely philanthropic. Through making your website accessible by accommodating the needs of audiences with disabilities, you unlock the goodwill and purchase ability of one quarter of your target audience. That figure rises significantly depending on your target audience&#8217;s demographics.</p>



<p>This is an audience with an estimated disposable income above $600 billion. Its goodwill can easily translate to increased revenues for your business.<br>The connection between user and business advantages, as outlined above, is natural. But ADA compliance benefits your business even beyond happier, more approachable page visitors.</p>



<p>The most obvious business benefit is avoiding legal jeopardy, such as violating Title III. According to one analysis, 2019 saw <a href="https://www.adatitleiii.com/2020/02/2019-was-another-record-breaking-year-for-federal-ada-title-iii-lawsuits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 11,000 lawsuits</a> related to ADA Title III violations. Over the past five years, that number has grown by an average of more than 20%.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not just large or small businesses, either. Brands as well-known as Domino&#8217;s and the Golden State Warriors have been sued because their websites weren&#8217;t ADA accessible in recent years.</p>



<p>Finally, it&#8217;s a reputation issue. A lawsuit, or even a reputation for not sufficiently catering to audiences with unique needs can be as harmful as a reputation for the opposite can be beneficial. Especially in highly regulated industries of public-private partnerships, ADA compliance becomes a business benefit and potential differentiator from your competition.</p>



<p>So much for the why. Next, we&#8217;ll explore the how of creating site-wide ADA compliance.</p>

<h2 style="color: #ffffff;">What, Exactly, Makes Your Websites ADA-Compliant?</h2>
</div>



<p>In almost every instance, lawsuits and judges, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, have all pointed to a simple way to make sure that your webpages are ADA compliant: follow the WCAG guidelines.</p>



<p>So let&#8217;s dig in. First published by the University of Wisconsin-Madison, they&#8217;ve been continually updated to account for new research, web developments, and the current digital landscape. The most recent WCAG 2.1 prompts websites to follow guidelines in 4 categories, with the acronym POUR:</p>



<ul><li>Perceivable</li><li>Operable</li><li>Understandable</li><li>Robust</li></ul>



<div class="wr-cta-container">
<div class="wr-cta-container-left"><strong>Protip</strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of them deserves further explanation. We have actionable tips from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/glance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WCAG&#8217;s quick guide</a> to achieve success in each category</p>
</div>
</div>



<h3>Perceivable</h3>



<p>Users with disabilities should be able to experience your webpages to its fullest success criteria. They might not be able to see the text, images, or video, so it&#8217;s all about providing alternative ways to consume your website&#8217;s individual pages.</p>



<h4>How to Make Your Websites Perceivable</h4>



<ul><li>Create ALT text for any non-text content on your site. That ALT text should describe the media in simple words.</li><li>Anytime multimedia like video appears on your site, provide captions for users with hearing disabilities.</li><li>Create your text in a way that accounts for assistive technologies like screen readers. That includes actions like following a predictable intro-text-conclusion structure and avoiding text on images.</li><li>Use color as a nonessential design choice, ensuring that color-blind users can still navigate your site. For instance, a green button is not enough to convey &#8216;go&#8217; without the word &#8216;go&#8217;.</li></ul>



<p>Ensure that audio playing on your site is nonessential and can be controlled rather than auto-playing on your website.</p>



<h3>Operable</h3>



<p>This principle is simple: all users, regardless of any devices they might use, should be able to navigate your website and all features you have to offer them. In other words, no part of your UI should negatively impact UX, regardless of disabilities or assistive technologies used.</p>



<h4>How to Make Your Websites Operable</h4>



<ul><li>Make sure that your website can be navigated with only a keyboard.<br>Make sure that alternative inputs, like voice recognition or mouse only, are just as smooth.</li><li>Give users enough time to read and consume the content, avoiding tight time limits or fast autoscrolling.</li><li>Avoid any content that could cause seizures or audiovisual confusion.</li><li>Provide navigation assistance, through intuitive menus and alternative ways to navigate (such as an internal site search).</li></ul>



<h3>Understandable</h3>



<p>This one is self-explanatory. Users with disabilities should be able to understand all content on your website as anyone else would. That includes both the main content and any instructions for additional tools on your site such as your navigation, search, or forms.</p>



<h4>How to Make Your Websites Understandable</h4>



<ul><li>Clarify the language of any page in its header HTML tag.<br>Avoid overuse of unusual terms such as jargon and idioms, which assistive technology may not be able to identify.</li><li>Make your content and navigation predictable, keeping it consistent throughout your website.</li></ul>



<p>Use labels, instructions, and error correction tools to help users with disabilities avoid and correct both their own mistakes and website errors.</p>



<h3>Robust</h3>



<p>Finally, an ADA-compliant website is robust in that it creates the same comprehensive experience for users with disabilities who need assistive technologies as it would for anyone else. In other words, compatibility with any tools a portion of your visitors might use is key to be compliant within this section.</p>



<h4>How to Make Your Websites Robust</h4>



<ul><li>Optimize HTML and any markup languages to create complete tags, avoid duplicates, and keep ID&#8217;s unique.</li><li>Ensure that all UI components have names and roles that can be determined programmatically and directly in the code.</li><li>Use status messages to provide feedback when users take sufficient action, such as a “success” message when someone fills out a form.</li></ul>



<p>Combine all techniques within the POUR acronym, and you get quite the complex web of needs to be truly WCAG 2.1 and ADA-compliant. The complete guide on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=413#principle1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WCAG website provides examples</a> and tips for each of the 50+ individual guidelines within those four overarching categories.</p>

<h2 style="color: #ffffff;">Introducing Our Secret Weapon for ADA Compliance</h2>
</div>



<p>You might be forgiven for getting just a bit nervous after reading the previous section. After all, one thing is clear: ADA website compliance is not an easy thing to accomplish. Done manually, it can consume your entire web development budget and resources—and even then, you still might miss a few steps and remain in legal jeopardy.</p>



<p>Fortunately, it doesn&#8217;t need to be a manual process. Allow us to introduce our secret weapon: <a href="https://accessibe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AccessiBe</a>, an accessibility tool that can make your website ADA compliant much more dynamically.</p>



<p>Gal Vizel, AccessiBe’s CEO spoke of his company in saying &#8220;We know that business owners do not knowingly want to leave their consumers out, not from their shops and not from their websites. AccessiBe makes website accessibility achievable for websites of all sizes so that people with disabilities can have access to a wider range of services, goods, products, and opportunities. We&#8217;re bridging the website accessibility gap, getting people with disabilities closer to the reality of an accessible web and to be able to use the web the way it was intended.&#8221;</p>



<h3>What is AccessiBe?</h3>



<p>The tool is simple: one line of JavaScript, added to your website. Once there, your website gains an accessibility interface that users with disabilities can use for features like zooming in, reading the screen, and enabling keyboard-based navigation.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a simple icon that users can click on to expand. Of course, that icon can be customized in both colors and placement to conform to your brand and website layout. From there, the interface helps any users with disabilities more easily navigate and experience your site.</p>



<p>That interface, though, is only the start of a more accessible experience. The rest happens in the background, with an automatic AI-based scan of your website that catches and corrects errors on an ongoing basis. Within 48 hours, your website is accessible and compliant —and it will stay that way as long as the tool is installed in your code.</p>



<p>AccessiBe&#8217;s goal is to make the entire internet accessible for users with disabilities by 2025. It&#8217;s ambitious, but based on this tool&#8217;s capabilities, it doesn&#8217;t seem out of the realm of possibility.</p>



<div style="padding: 40px 60px; margin: 60px -10%; background-color: #222222; border-radius: 2px;">
<h5 id="chapter4" style="text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: 2px; color: #ec4067;">Chapter 4:</h5>
<h2 style="color: #ffffff;">How AccessiBe Can Help Your Website Succeed</h2>
</div>



<p>Now, here’s how you get things started. AccessiBe can help your website get and stay compliant within the POUR acronym described above.</p>



<ul><li>Perceivable: the tool scans your website and adds ALT text to any images missing it. It can also provide captions and, through its integrated screen reader, optimize text to match it.</li><li>Operable: the tool optimizes and completes coding to allow for alternative inputs, including the correct tagging of links, popups, navigational menus, and more.</li><li>Understandable: Navigation and labels get fixed up in the code of the site itself, and jargon and technical terms are flagged as needed.</li><li>Robust: the tool&#8217;s contextual machine learning allows for continuous optimization of HTML within the site, including correction of labels of any core UI components.</li></ul>



<p>AccessiBe&#8217;s <a href="https://accessibe.com/product/artificial-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">artificial intelligence page</a> further explains the process and various ways it can help you become and remain compliant with all relevant accessibility guidelines. The result is a truly optimized website that ultimately improves your user interface experience, regardless of its needs and challenges.</p>

<h2 style="color: #ffffff;">Next Steps to an ADA-Compliant Website</h2>
</div>



<p>So much for our secret weapon. But what, exactly, should you do to truly reach ADA site compliance? We suggest a few core steps that can help you get there:</p>



<ul><li>Complete a <a href="https://ace.accessibe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">site accessibility audit</a>. That gives you a great idea of where your business stands and where your website needs improvements.</li><li>Research the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and WCAG trends in your industry. While this guide works great as an introduction, plenty of industry and audience-specific nuances exist. The more familiar you are with them, the better.Talk to your legal team. Whether you have your own legal department or work with an external lawyer, an expert can give you a good perspective on the importance of ADA compliance.</li><li>Look for a website partner. Especially if going through the process on your own is daunting, finding a partner can go a long way towards calming your worries.</li><li>Leverage the right tools (Yep, this is where we mention AccessiBe again.) Knowing the tools at your disposal can help you act quickly to make your website accessible.</li></ul>



<p>Ultimately, ADA compliance benefits everyone. It improves your website&#8217;s user experience and unlocks a significant part of your target audience. As a result, your potential revenue and profitability rises accordingly. And of course, you ease the worries of company leadership by decreasing legal liabilities, while simultaneously improving your reputation as an accessible, compliant business.<br>And, once you break it down, it&#8217;s not as daunting as it appears at first. At the end of the day, you’ll likely feel similar to countless other businesses addressing this demand. You&#8217;ll want to make your website&#8217;s ADA-compliance a priority.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>What&#8217;s it like to use your product or service? How do your customers interact with them, and what do they feel when they use it?</p>



<p>The answer to those questions is your user experience (UX).</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not just something that happens. It&#8217;s something that you have to build towards with a critical analysis of your product or service. With the <a href="https://www.coverwallet.com/business-tips/miller-media-7" rel="noopener">right UX strategy</a>, you can influence and shape it in a way that builds business success.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not a simple task. But it&#8217;s well worth your time and effort.</p>



<p>Interested in how you can develop an effective UX strat? In this article, we&#8217;ll talk through:</p>



<span id="more-29706"></span>



<ul><li>The nuances of a UX strategy</li><li>How it benefits your business</li><li>And how you can create your own UX strategy</li></ul>



<div class="ChapterFullwidth" style="background-image:url(https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-form">
<a id="chapter 1"></a>
</div><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">Chapter 1</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">What is UX Strategy?</h2></div></div>



<p>Let&#8217;s start by thinking about the two concepts of the word: UX and strategy. &#8220;UX&#8221; is short for user experience, the way your audience feels when they use your product or service. &#8220;Strategy&#8221; stands for an intentional plan to get from where you are to where you want to be. Put them together, and you have your definition.</p>



<p>A user experience strategy, in short, is the intentional effort to influence the way your audience feels when they use your product or service.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not about the features or even the theoretical benefits of your product . UX is much more nuanced than that. It&#8217;s about the intangibles, the thoughts, and feelings you can unearth in your customers that ultimately lead to satisfaction and brand loyalty.</p>



<p>Nike is an amazing example of strategic UX. Nike produces great quality shoes, but probably not that much better than its competitors in terms of its materials and production process.</p>



<p>And yet, it&#8217;s got an almost cult-like following. A new Air Jordan? People line up for hours to get it. That&#8217;s because it prompts feelings of being the best, a rare combination of both scarcity and quality.</p>



<p>Those feelings don&#8217;t happen by accident. Nike has spent decades building its brand to get to that point. Stated differently: Nike has consciously invested in user experience strategy.</p>



<div class="ChapterFullwidth" style="background-image:url(https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-form">
<a id="chapter 2"></a>
</div><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">Chapter 2</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">How Your UX Strategy Can Help Your Business Thrive</h2></div></div>



<p>Knowing what UX strategy actually means is half the game. Understanding its benefits? That&#8217;s how you can invest the resources to start actually building the thing.</p>



<p>Think of your UX strategy as the backbone of your product or service design. Getting to the final product will take significant time and resources. Especially as you grow your business, you need to make sure you spend it wisely.</p>



<p>Great designers can make something look good. Great engineers can build a sound product. Great writers can put the words to it. UX strategy, though, is the only thing that makes the whole greater than those parts.</p>



<p>If you build it in the beginning, you&#8217;ve set the course to success. You can make sure that none of your teams wastes time working on something that won&#8217;t engage your audience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, it helps you minimize uncertainty, helping you understand whether your audience actually wants (and needs) the features you&#8217;re building. You can solve actual problems, instead of just working based on assumptions.</p>



<p>Minimizing uncertainty, in turn, helps to minimize risks. You don&#8217;t end up having to validate something that&#8217;s already built. Instead, with validation out of the way, everything you build drives towards well-established (and data-based) goals.</p>



<p>In other words, you build a roadmap towards a product that your audience actually wants. That&#8217;s probably why, <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/do-you-need-a-ux-strategy-e30a65fac82e#:~:text=Businesses%20that%20do%20so%20enjoy,Research's%20Customer%20Experience%20Index%20Ranking." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Forrester Research</a>, organizations that prioritize user experience outperform their peers by an average of 43%.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why, to truly grow towards success, UX strategy isn&#8217;t optional. It&#8217;s a vital part of making sure that your products, and business as a whole, are spending all of their resources on solving actual customer problems.</p>



<p>So much for the why. You have your case for building the UX strategy. Next, we&#8217;ll tell you how to do it.</p>



<div class="ChapterFullwidth" style="background-image:url(https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-form">
<a id="chapter 3"></a>
</div><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">Chapter 3</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">How to Form your UX Strategy</h2></div></div>



<p>At its core, building your UX strategy is a four-step process. But it&#8217;s also iterative. The fourth step automatically leads to the first step, and the cycle repeats. You&#8217;ll see what we mean.</p>



<p>Start this process early. Get all the buy-in you need, making your case as described above, well before you start designing an actual product. Then, walk through these steps to maximize your chance at a positive UX by the time the product is complete.</p>



<h3>Step 1: Gather Relevant Information</h3>



<p>As with so much in business, the first step is user research. Simply put, you need to gather and structure lots of information to make sure every decision after this one is grounded in data.</p>



<p>Your goal: to understand as much as you possibly could about your audience, their customer journey, their pain points, and their wants and desires. That&#8217;s not easy, but you can follow a few simple steps to get there.</p>



<p>First, you can conduct basic customer surveys. Make sure you have a representative and large-enough sample, then ask simple questions about your industry. Build a profile of your audience that&#8217;s both demographic and psychographic.</p>



<p>Of course, you can also get more specific. Along with quantitative survey data, invite current and potential customers in for focus groups.</p>



<p>Pose a few general questions, and see how they direct. Focus the conversation on your business and the problems you&#8217;re trying to solve. If you have a prototype, you can show it to them here to get some initial reactions.</p>



<p>Finally, leverage electronic data through processes like user behavior tracking. Try to understand how your audience typically finds your business, and how they interact with you once they do. You can also expand this exercise far beyond your own website for additional insights.</p>



<p>If you have a product or prototype, get it in front of your audience and gauge reactions. But you don&#8217;t absolutely need it for this initial phase. All you need is as much information as you can get about your audience to start mapping their user journey along with the problems they&#8217;re facing.</p>



<h3>Step 2: Define Your Goals</h3>



<p>You have the data. Now, it&#8217;s time to analyze it. That&#8217;s best done by driving towards the specific goals you want your UX strategy to accomplish.</p>



<p>For your user experience strategy to be successful, these goals need to be intentional and specific. Your product, just like your company, won&#8217;t (and shouldn&#8217;t) be everything to everyone. Instead, it should solve a very specific need. This is where you define how you can get there.</p>



<h4>Goals MUST Be Specific Objectives.&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Think of goals as your specific objectives, the things to aim for in order to call your product design a success. In other words, they make sure you can easily get from point A (no product) to point B (a successful product that solves audience problems).</p>



<p>Goals should be specific, measurable, actionable, realistic, and timely. (hey, that spells <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/smart-goal-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SMART</a>!) Beyond those parameters, there are almost no limits to where the data could lead you:</p>



<ul><li>You can set a goal of optimizing your entire user journey for speed, minimizing the time it takes to get from first discovery to using your product.</li><li>You can set a goal of optimizing functionality, keeping the product&#8217;s extraneous features at a minimum to get straight to the point and solve the problem.</li><li>You can set a goal of making the product stand out visually, which matters when it usually appears in the context of its competition.</li><li>You can set a goal of responsiveness, extending the user experience into the interactions (like customer support) your audience will have with you after the initial buy.</li></ul>



<p>We could keep going. The key here is not to come up with some goals on your own. Instead, it&#8217;s about leveraging the data you&#8217;ve gathered, setting your goals to respond to your audience&#8217;s actual, observed, and proven problems.</p>



<h3>Step 3: Start Building Something Great</h3>



<p>You&#8217;re getting close. With your user experience goals in place, it&#8217;s time to start building. That&#8217;s easier said than done, of course; but it&#8217;s a heck of a lot easier if you know exactly what you&#8217;re building towards.</p>



<h4>Start With Your Key Features</h4>



<p>What are the core pieces of the product or website you&#8217;re building, the pieces that most closely match your value proposition, and your audience&#8217;s needs? Define those early, then make sure everything else orbits around them.</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t stop there, though. Great user experience design means getting every little detail right. It means making sure that every touchpoint you have with your customers is a positive one, building loyalty, and goodwill in the process.</p>



<h4>Don&#8217;t Be Afraid To Widen The Project Scope</h4>



<p>Look beyond what you&#8217;re building, and into your audience&#8217;s context when they&#8217;ll interact with you. Then, build something specifically designed to fit and match within that context.</p>



<h4>Work Within Your Means</h4>



<p>Don&#8217;t go above and beyond what you&#8217;re trying to do. Start with the simplest, most straightforward way to achieve your audience&#8217;s (and your own) goals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That means always keeping your requirements and your goals in mind. It also means keeping a close eye on your budget to make sure you don&#8217;t exceed it.</p>



<p>But in the meantime, never forget the core lesson: to always build your product with your users front and center.</p>



<h3>Step 4: Measure &amp; Improve Over Time</h3>



<p>You&#8217;ve almost made it. At this point, your UX strategy already includes the building process. But it doesn&#8217;t end there. Like everything else in life, it tends to loop around.</p>



<h4>Don&#8217;t Be Afraid To Question Yourself</h4>



<p>Don&#8217;t just assume that your initial user research and goal setting was perfect. Instead, start to track everything you do against success benchmarks. Measuring your work helps you discover blind spots, make tweaks, and improve your product over time.</p>



<p>A good UX strategy is only as good as its execution. And you only know how good that execution is if you are able to measure it.</p>



<p>You already know how your audience feels about you. That&#8217;s your baseline. Now, use the same mechanisms to see whether you can track any improvements in these attitudes over time.</p>



<h4>Set New Benchmarks</h4>



<p>You can also bring in other benchmarks. For web design, for instance, KPIs like bounce rate, time on page, and conversion rates can be incredibly helpful. They all tell you how your audience is interacting with your product (the website), and where you might need to improve.</p>



<h4>Rinse &amp; Repeat</h4>



<p>And so the wheel keeps spinning. Step four leads directly into step one, which leads to setting new or adjusted goals, building something new, and tracking it again. This type of iteration is crucial to make sure that over time, you work towards the best possible user experience you could give your audience.</p>



<div class="huemorProtip-container" style="background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><h2 class="huemorProtip-title" style="color:black">Protip</h2><p style="color:black" class="huemorProtip-description">If you&#8217;re curious how this strategy could practically be applied to your website, we suggest checking out some of our key posts from our <a href="/website-optimization-series">website optimization series</a></p><div class="huemorProtip-button"></div></div>



<div class="ChapterFullwidth" style="background-image:url(https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-form">
<a id="chapter 4"></a>
</div><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">Chapter 4</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">Wrapping Up</h2></div></div>



<p>Building UX strategy is not a simple concept. At first glance, it can actually seem quite complicated. But that doesn&#8217;t mean you should avoid it. Quite the opposite, in fact.</p>



<p>Yes, you&#8217;re spending extra time and money on a process that you could just circumvent. But think about what happens if you circumvent it. You&#8217;re flying blind, building a website or product that might never actually solve your audience&#8217;s problems.</p>



<p>UX strategy is an intentional effort to improve the way your audience feels about your products and your brand. It takes a concept like <a href="https://insights.huemor.rocks/blog/why-innovative-website-design-is-key" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">innovative website design</a>, and adds a simple descriptor: innovative website design that satisfies your audience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the process, you get significant long-term cost and time savings, along with the improved ROI mentioned above. That combination makes UX strategy far from optional. It becomes an essential component in everything you do.</p>



<p>Yes, you&#8217;ll need market research. Yes, you&#8217;ll need to spend some time setting your goals. And yes, you&#8217;ll need to invest in tracking and improving your efforts over time. But what you get in the end, a tangibly improved user experience leading to increased business success, is well worth that effort.</p>



<p>Even better, a comprehensive UX strategy can guide all of your future efforts. Those <a href="https://insights.huemor.rocks/blog/100-ecommerce-web-design-tips-to-skyrocket-sales" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web design tips</a> you&#8217;ve read about? In the context of strategic prioritization of your user experience, they&#8217;ll become that much more effective.</p>



<p>So, whether you outsource your UX or plan to do it in-house, the investment you make will pay off significantly over time.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It&#8217;s not great to feel old. It&#8217;s even worse when you appear old. So do you really want your website to get to that point?</p>



<p>The internet is constantly changing. A website that was top-of-line even a few years ago suddenly feels outdated, difficult to manage, or just not up to snuff. That&#8217;s when you know it&#8217;s time for a website revamp.</p>



<p>A bad website can kill your business. Once conversion rates are down or customers start to complain, you know you have a problem. At that point, it might be time to seriously think about a website revamp.</p>



<p>When Orbit Media did some research, they found that the <a href="https://www.orbitmedia.com/blog/website-lifespan-and-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">average lifespan of a website</a> is just over 2.5 years. So don&#8217;t default to thinking it&#8217;s not yet time for a replacement. That time comes quicker than you might anticipate.</p>



<p>The good news is that you can do something about it. So let&#8217;s walk through that &#8220;something.&#8221; We&#8217;ll start with the signs you need to look out for to signal a website revamp, before digging into next steps once those signs begin to appear.</p>



<h5 id="chapter1">&nbsp;</h5>



<div class="ChapterFullwidth" style="background-image:url(https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-form">
<a id="chapter1"></a>
</div><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">Chapter 1</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">The 7 Signs It&#8217;s Time for a Website Revamp</h2></div></div>



<p>These are your red flags. If one appears, start looking for some others. If you see more than one, jump to the next steps about redesigning websites. Here we go:</p>



<h3>1) Your Conversions and/or Online Sales are Down</h3>



<p>When your visitors like what they see on your site, they tend to take the next step that gets them closer to their goals. That might be subscribing to a newsletter, becoming a lead, or buying something online.</p>



<p>When those conversion rates and sales drop on your current website, you&#8217;re in trouble.</p>



<p>To be clear: there are a number of reasons your conversions might be dropping while traffic is staying relatively the same. But your website design and set up might be among them. So it&#8217;s at least worth investigating further.</p>



<p>When your design, content, or user experience is bad, your users don&#8217;t trust you. They don&#8217;t want to give you their information, and certainly don&#8217;t want to buy from you. It might be time for a website revamp.</p>



<h3>2) Your Customers are Complaining</h3>



<p>Conversion rates dropping are tangible metrics. But it also helps to pay attention to the intangible, like the complaints you hear from your website visitors.</p>



<p>Remember: customer satisfaction is paramount. They&#8217;ll tell you when they&#8217;re unhappy, and you should listen when that happens. If they&#8217;re not enjoying their user experience, it needs to improve.</p>



<p>Customer complaints about your website can result from a number of reasons, many of them appearing below. But it&#8217;s also important to remember that they&#8217;re not always able to articulate them.</p>



<p>Yes, they might be mad because the site doesn&#8217;t work well on mobile devices or is slow. But they might express it simply by saying they didn&#8217;t get what they wanted to. Listen to both the specific and general complaints when considering a web revamp.</p>



<h3>3) Your Bounce Rates are High</h3>



<p>You know that feeling when you show up to something, it just isn&#8217;t what you expected, so you bounce? The digital equivalent of that is your website&#8217;s bounce rates.</p>



<p>Put simply, this metric describes the percentage of customers who land on your website, but exit it without ever navigating onto a page that&#8217;s different from the one they landed on. In other words, a single page convinced them that your site wasn&#8217;t what they needed, so they moved on without converting or otherwise learning more about you.</p>



<p>That actually happens a lot. A bounce rate of about 50% is still considered acceptable in most industries. Above that, though? You might need to <a href="https://startup.unitelvoice.com/new-business-website" rel="noopener">redesign the website</a>.</p>



<p>Visitors who bounce don&#8217;t like what they see. They&#8217;re frustrated by the content, the design, or the overall user experience. In some cases, a simple tweak can help. In others, though, a comprehensive website revamp is necessary.</p>



<h3>4) Your Website Design is not Mobile-Friendly</h3>



<p>Building your site for smartphones and tablets is no longer optional. It&#8217;s 2022; about <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">half of all online traffic</a> comes from mobile devices, and industries like entertainment and travel are seeing particularly high <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/08/13/google-ads-mobile-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">click-through rates on mobile</a>.</p>



<p>Your website needs to account for that fact. When it doesn&#8217;t, you risk alienating your customers and depressing your conversion rates.</p>



<p>That means being mobile-first, not just mobile-accommodating. Benchmarking tools like <a href="https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google&#8217;s Mobile Friendly Test</a> can be a great resource to help you gauge your website&#8217;s ability to fly high in this area.</p>



<h3>5) Your Website is Slow (or Slowing Down)</h3>



<p>When your website slows down, it might be time to put it out to pasture. Almost <a href="https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/speed-up-your-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">half your audience expects</a> your website to load in 2 seconds or less, and the rest is not much more patient. If it doesn&#8217;t, you might be looking at lost revenue.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s not an exaggeration. Search Engine Journal notes that <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/nearly-70-of-consumers-say-page-speed-impacts-their-purchasing-decisions/290235/#close" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">70% of customers say</a> slow load times affect their purchasing decisions. Meanwhile, <a href="https://smallseotools.com/blog/google-hates-your-site-because-its-slow-heres-what-to-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">every second delay results</a> in a 7% loss of conversions and 16% decreased customer experience.</p>



<p>So yes, your website slowing down is a major red flag. Use slow load times as a major reason why you might be looking at a website revamp.</p>



<h3>6) You&#8217;re Starting to Uncover Technical Problems</h3>



<p>On an even simpler level, you might just need an update because what&#8217;s under the hood doesn&#8217;t perform well anymore. When you uncover major technical problems, think about a redo.</p>



<p>Those technical problems might include pages not loading, forms not working, and 404 errors. It might be a website design using Flash, which doesn&#8217;t tend to work in modern browsers. Or it might simply have gotten infected with malware.</p>



<p>Third-party integrations are another potential problem. If you need plugins like calendars or lead generation forms to work, but your website simply cannot accommodate them, look for a website revamp that helps you solve those technical issues.</p>



<h3>7) Your Site is Difficult to Manage</h3>



<p>Let&#8217;s turn inward to the last red flag. All of the above signs are about your audience. But you also matter! If you can&#8217;t manage your website well enough, think twice about keeping it going.</p>



<p>Your website needs to be agile. It needs to be able to grow with you, remaining flexible as you explore new types of content or opportunities like eCommerce.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Older websites tend to be built using static HTML code, which requires fluency in two programming languages (HTML and CSS) even for simple updates. Modern websites are powered by content management systems, which build on an existing design to make content updates easy and straightforward.</p>



<p>No technical expertise required. You can even add multiple managers to the site, further streamlining updates. You need that flexibility as your business evolves.</p>



<div class="ChapterFullwidth" style="background-image:url(https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-form">
<a id="chapter2"></a>
</div><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">Chapter 2</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">3 Next Steps to Kick Off Your Website Revamp</h2></div></div>



<p>Have you noticed some of the problems above for your own website? Uh-oh. You might want to think about what to do next. Or, even better, read what we&#8217;d recommend for those next steps.</p>



<p>This doesn&#8217;t have to be complicated. It should be comprehensive, though. These action steps can help you get your website revamp done right.</p>



<h3>Step 1: Survey Your Top Customers</h3>



<p>As always, it starts with your audience. You need to understand their needs before you can begin to think about your own when planning a website redesign.</p>



<p>Remember that your website&#8217;s first and most important goal is to earn you business. You can only earn that business if you make your customers and visitors happy. That&#8217;s why you need to start with an understanding of what drives them.</p>



<h4>For Direct To Consumer Brands</h4>



<p>For B2C organizations, that might mean a survey form that helps you understand their needs, pain points, and expectations. Actually, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeCbmf19SjQzLcv_r2qE55HPnZ8_VRKNqB-dSsyFztLwICgsA/viewform?__hstc=224151812.deb360e8563c043c353fd08333a6dba8.1617054148392.1645628420595.1645631157163.490&amp;__hssc=224151812.2.1645631157163&amp;__hsfp=3409546825&amp;hsCtaTracking=eec4280d-9812-43e2-b97b-c8e9aae4239e%7Cca598ec4-baaa-48ea-917b-921e1a75071d">we have a sample you can use as a reference point</a>.</p>



<h4>For B2B Brands</h4>



<p>For organizations that target business buyers, it&#8217;s more about individual relationships. The buying cycle is longer and more complex. So a 1on1 call or interview with a few key accounts may work better than a broad, generalized survey.</p>



<p>Either way, your goal is the same: find out what they enjoy most about their company. Understand their experience with your company, through all your channels.</p>



<p>Then, ask for feedback specifically related to your website design. What do they currently like? Where do they get stuck? What are the biggest improvement opportunities you might be able to leverage on a website revamp?</p>



<p>This is your opportunity to get some honest, straightforward answers for your new website. Hold on to them; they&#8217;ll come in handy in future steps.</p>



<h3>Step 2: Compare Responses to Your Website</h3>



<p>You&#8217;ve got the insights. Now, what do you do with them?</p>



<p>First, analyze them. Make sure you truly understand what your customers are trying to tell you. Look for both trends and outliers to understand exactly what paths you need to pursue on your new website.</p>



<p>Then, start laying out those priorities against your existing website. How well are you hitting on the points that your customers like? Are you truly getting across the features that make your business unique?</p>



<p>The opposite part of the analysis is just as crucial. Can you find consistent themes in the areas your customers don&#8217;t like? Where could you get some easy wins through quick improvements?</p>



<p>Finally, think through your audience&#8217;s general likes and dislikes about your business. Look for opportunities to connect those directly to your website in order to make it more beneficial to them and their pain points.</p>



<div class="huemorProtip-container" style="background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><h2 class="huemorProtip-title" style="color:black">Protip</h2><p style="color:black" class="huemorProtip-description">Heads-up: this is not an easy process. It requires diligent analysis and the ability to translate that analysis into real improvements. But it&#8217;s a crucial step to help you understand both where you stand and where you want to (and need to) go.</p><div class="huemorProtip-button"></div></div>



<h3>Step 3: Assess Your Capabilities for the Revamp</h3>



<p>You have your end goals, and the plan for a new website that your customers would consider the dream. At long last, it&#8217;s time to figure out how exactly you can get there.</p>



<p>Above all, that means figuring out your options in actually getting that website revamp done. Because, as it turns out, you have more than one.</p>



<p>First, you can try to handle it with your own, in-house team. You&#8217;ll need professionals experienced enough to handle project management, design, and development requirements. And you need to be confident in the end result.</p>



<p>If that&#8217;s not an option, the next option might be hiring a freelancer. It&#8217;s usually the least expensive option and offers a good amount of flexibility. But you&#8217;re also a bit limited in the scope of the project and tied to a single individual.</p>



<p>Alternatively, you can hire an agency. Especially a specialized web design agency might be a great fit—if you have the budget for it. If you do, you can typically rely on a dedicated team helping you build that website.</p>



<div class="huemorProtip-container" style="background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><h2 class="huemorProtip-title" style="color:black">Instant Project Estimate</h2><p style="color:black" class="huemorProtip-description">Curious what a project with us may cost?

<p>If you do go with the agency options, you might need (or want) a <a href="https://insights.huemor.rocks/blog/website-redesign-rfp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web redesign RFP</a>. Make sure you get it right to actually help you find the right partner.</p>



<p>Which of these is the right choice?</p>

<p>Yes, taking a comprehensive look can be tedious. It might even be painful. But that doesn&#8217;t make it any less necessary to redesign a website.</p>



<p>The internet moves fast, and so does your audience. Can your website keep up? If not, a website revamp should be a serious consideration.</p>



<p>Once you internalize the above seven signs, you can check for them regularly. If more than one pops up or can&#8217;t be fixed by a simple repair, a revamp begins to enter the equation.</p>



<div class="huemorProtip-container" style="background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><h2 class="huemorProtip-title" style="color:black">Protip</h2><p style="color:black" class="huemorProtip-description">Try to avoid hiring a &#8216;jack-of-all-trades&#8217; agency. Instead, focus on agencies that specialize in <a href="https://huemor.rocks/services/website-redesigns">website redesign services</a> instead. They&#8217;ll have a much deeper understanding of the nuance that goes into the overall process and in turn, be able to produce a better end result.</p><div class="huemorProtip-button"></div></div>



<p>When that&#8217;s the case, don&#8217;t hesitate or dwell on the resources you&#8217;ll need. Instead, look at the positives. Think about the additional revenue and customer satisfaction, not to mention the improved management capabilities you&#8217;ll have.</p>



<p>And then, jump in to get started. Follow the above three steps to dive into that redesign and transform your online presence.</p>



<p>Over to you: have you come across websites that were seriously in need of a revamp? And have you ever thought about translating those thoughts to your own web presence? Leave your thoughts in the comments and let&#8217;s talk.</p>
