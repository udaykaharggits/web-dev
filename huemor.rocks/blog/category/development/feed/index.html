										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Launching a website is one of the most stressful parts of any web development project. Many things can be easily overlooked during a website&#8217;s launch, even when it’s handled by the most seasoned experts.</p>



<span id="more-29672"></span>



<p>Forgetting to test a data capture point can lead to the site missing out on gathering a significant portion of new leads. Meanwhile, a site that hasn’t been set up correctly may lag behind in search rankings. And it takes only a single mistake to redo many processes in developing a new website or even redeveloping an existing website.</p>



<p>If you’ve owned and operated a website for quite some time, you know that its design is crucial for its effectiveness in driving leads and sales.</p>



<p>Right now, you may feel like your site is starting to look outdated compared to those of your competitors. It might be that you’re experiencing low traffic recently despite the growing market demand. With the issues plaguing your site, you might be considering a <a href="/blog/website-redesign" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website redesign and wondering how you might go about it</a>.</p>



<p>No matter the case, it’s important to have a reliable launch checklist you can follow to ensure your new site has the highest probability to be successful.</p>



<p>To help you with its launch, we’ve prepared a guide that will help you to get your site off the ground. You can expect guidance on the following aspects of your website launch:</p>



<ul><li>Technical and server</li><li>SEO and content</li><li>Design</li><li>Analytics</li><li>Things to test</li><li>Post-launch</li></ul>



<p>Without further ado, here are the most important website launch tips you should consider when doing a redesign.</p>

<![endif]-->
<script charset="utf-8" type="text/javascript" src="//js.hsforms.net/forms/v2.js"></script>

  hbspt.forms.create({
	region: "na1",
	portalId: "6606556",
	formId: "93c91c8a-4370-49a5-93ad-2575b57f41ad"
});
</script>
</div></div>



<h2>Technical and Server</h2>



<p>The following are the things you should do for your website’s server as well as other technical aspects of your site’s layout:</p>



<p>Obtain required licenses for third-party plugins and software: You want to ensure that all third-party plugins and software for your website have all the necessary licenses to operate as needed. Although using a temporary license as people develop the site is acceptable, you want to switch to permanent ones that will continue to work even as the website goes live.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Incorporate Secure Sockets Layers (SSL) protocol:</span></h4>



<p>This protocol verifies the ID of a site while allowing for more security in terms of data transfer with Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). A website that doesn’t have the SSL protocol in place may have a “not secure” label attached to it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="328" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/security-1.jpg" alt="security 1" class="wp-image-30187" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/security-1.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/security-1-300x96.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/security-1-768x246.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/security-1-24x8.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/security-1-36x12.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/security-1-48x15.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update the content management system (CMS) you’re using:</span></h4>



<p>Updating your CMS ensures that your site remains stable even after the launch while providing you with the latest features.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Perform a backup of your current website:</span></h4>



<p>This “just in case” option can be critical, especially since it provides you with something to fall back on in case things go wrong with the launch. You can also use a backup of your site to trace back and see which part of the website caused a specific problem. This will also help in creating an existing database of your site&#8217;s previous pages such as the landing page and various homepage displays.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Make sure your email authentication records are updated:</span></h4>



<p>Your Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and DomainKeys Identified Mail protocols are necessary for authenticating an IP and domain address. Having these records on hand ensures that you can send emails to their target destinations soon after launch.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Check to see that your CDN is configured correctly:</span></h4>



<p>Your content delivery network allows for fast asset transfers on loading various internet content such as images, videos, HTML pages, stylesheets, and Javascript files.</p>



<h2>SEO and Content</h2>



<p>This website checklist involves everything you need for SEO and your site’s content:</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ensure the robots.txt file of your website is updated:</span></h4>



<p>A properly configured robots.txt file will inform search engine crawlers which pages they should index on your site. Besides helping avoid overloading your website with index requests, an ideal robots.txt file will also benefit its search engine optimization (SEO) aspect.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ensure that all site versions resolve to a single version:</span></h4>



<p>The modern websites we are now using have at least four different versions (for example, https://site-name.com, http://site-name.com, https://www.site-name.com, and http://www.site-name.com). There’s no one site variant that is better than the others, yet it’s crucial that you configure these sites to point towards one URL that’s easy to recognize. This benefits not only your SEO but also your site’s user experience.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Revise the tags and meta data used on your website:</span></h4>



<p>For your technical SEO components you want to prioritize your targeted keywords and key phrases first. From there, you can work on your title tags and meta tags to ensure that they are different for each page. Page titles are also important and can help differentiate your new website. This will help make your new website state out for major search engines and allow for easier search engine indexing.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Format your headings:</span></h4>



<p>You’ll want to make sure you have proper headings above your website&#8217;s body text and ensure these are formatted correctly with the proper font size. These should enhance readability and be consistent across your web pages.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="663" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Headings-1.jpg" alt="Headings 1" class="wp-image-30188" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Headings-1.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Headings-1-300x194.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Headings-1-768x497.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Headings-1-24x16.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Headings-1-36x23.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Headings-1-48x31.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Source: <a href="http://kabertech.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KaberTech</a></figcaption></figure>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Check that all of your links are connected correctly:</span></h4>



<p>You want all of your links to other pages to be linked accordingly and not redirected to irrelevant locations. This is a great opportunity to check for any possible broken links that may include internal and external links.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">All pages should have the necessary elements included:</span></h4>



<p>Make sure that each web page on your site has the appropriate body texts, calls to action, and images present. You should consider adding alt text for CTAs and images in case there are problems loading your site. Do some usability testing and make sure those CTAs are working as they should!</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Configure redirects properly:</span></h4>



<p>Make sure that any web page URL that has changed should incorporate a redirect. It should link from its original location to the new destination to provide users with a seamless browsing experience.</p>



<p>Block thank you and confirmation pages from Google indexing. These two types of pages have little SEO value and should not compete with your other pages in the search rankings.</p>



<h2>Design</h2>



<p>Here is the checklist for the overall design of your website:</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Review all of the images on your website:</span></h4>



<p>An important part of this website checklist is to ensure that all images you use have been reviewed before launch. You want to ensure those obtained from outside sources should have the appropriate licenses to avoid penalties.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Standardize your website’s fonts:</span></h4>



<p>You want to ensure that everything stays consistent throughout each web page on your site. The most convenient way to do this is to create your own style guide before development begins so that you can significantly cut down on the time needed for this step.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Double-check the accessibility of your website’s design:</span></h4>



<p>You want to make sure that the fonts and colors used in your site are easy for users to read, with high contrast between the background and text. Screen readers should be able to read the content on your site to users, and multimedia content should have captions that allow users to watch videos without needing to hear them. Finally, you should make your website navigable even by just using the keyboard, mouse, or voice. You can check out our <a href="/blog/our-secret-to-ada-site-compliance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WCAG and ADA article</a> for more details on this.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Your navigation menus should be intuitive and easy to use:</span></h4>



<p>Users should not have to click through pages of menus to find what they need. If they do, they’re likely to leave your site or at least have a frustrating experience. Make it easy for your website users by making your menus clear, simple, and easy to navigate.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Create a favicon and custom app icon:</span></h4>



<p>You can create your own unique favicon and custom app icon to make it easier for people to recognize your site when it is bookmarked, added to a user’s home screen, or in a web browser tab.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Make sure your site should have a custom featured image on each page:</span></h4>



<p>These images are important in engaging site visitors that arrive on your website and can help improve overall site design.</p>

<h2>Analytics</h2>



<p>Analytics is a must-have feature for today’s websites. Failing to keep track and maintain positive analytics will make a site fall down in rankings.</p>



<p>Here are the things to consider in terms of analytics:</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Set up Google Analytics for your site:</span></h4>



<p>You want free tools such as <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/academy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Analytics</a> up and running for your website so that it can track the performance of each web page. This tool is extremely useful since it ties directly to your search engine optimization. You want to make sure that all relevant social media tracking scripts are set up and working as intended. You’ll also want to filter the IP addresses of you and your employees, so it does not affect your analytics.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="706" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Analytics-1.jpg" alt="Analytics 1" class="wp-image-30191" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Analytics-1.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Analytics-1-300x207.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Analytics-1-768x530.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Analytics-1-24x17.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Analytics-1-36x25.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Analytics-1-48x33.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Link your website to Google Search Console:</span></h4>



<p>The <a href="https://search.google.com/search-console/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Search Console</a> web service allows your webmasters to assess the indexing status of your site and see what changes they can make to optimize its online visibility.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Set analytics goals for your website:</span></h4>



<p>Setting goals for your website will help you determine whether it is performing as intended or not. It will let you see if your site is driving traffic successfully or failing to bring in the necessary traffic to grow.</p>



<h2>Things to Test</h2>



<p>Before doing a website launch, we suggest that you do a formal “user acceptance testing” first. This type of testing lets people visit your site, see if it’s working, observe for any errors, and perform tests before it goes live.</p>



<p>Here are the things you need to test before launching your redesigned website:</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Compare designs to other web pages:</span></h4>



<p>Performing comparison checks on other pages within the site helps ensure that everything is correct and consistent. Site users want the best experience possible when browsing and will prefer sites that offer consistency in that regard.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Test all of the forms on your website before launch:</span></h4>



<p>Make sure that you test areas like the Contact Us page, Demo page, and email responses to see if they work properly. You want to see that the emails can reach inboxes successfully upon form completion. Then, you should check that the CRM or marketing automation system you are using can successfully receive key data for new contacts or deals.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Test storage locations:</span></h4>



<p>Check and make sure that all locations where uploads and downloads happen are working properly.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Test for site compatibility:</span></h4>



<p>You want your website to be compatible with all browsers and mobile devices for maximum reach. You can use tools like <a href="https://www.lambdatest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LambdaTest</a> to emulate and test various screens since it will inform you of any incompatibilities that you can fix. By running browser tests you are making sure your new website is working properly via different browsers and that all of the site&#8217;s pages are able to be viewed on browsers such as Chrome, Safari, etc. as well as on a mobile device such as a phone or tablet.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="706" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/things-to-test-cernucci-2.jpg" alt="things to test cernucci 2" class="wp-image-30192" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/things-to-test-cernucci-2.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/things-to-test-cernucci-2-300x207.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/things-to-test-cernucci-2-768x530.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/things-to-test-cernucci-2-24x17.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/things-to-test-cernucci-2-36x25.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/things-to-test-cernucci-2-48x33.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Test your website speed:</span></h4>



<p>It’s important for any website today to load everything in a reasonable amount of time. Sites that are unable to load in under 3 seconds start to experience high bounce rates. You can use professional tools like <a href="https://gtmetrix.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GTMetrix</a> that will provide you with in-depth insights on which areas are problematic and what could be causing your site to load slowly.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Check that all links lead to the right place:</span></h4>



<p>You want to be meticulous here and ensure that all links on your site will lead people to their intended destinations. Tools like <a href="https://www.deadlinkchecker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeadLink</a> can make this process easier due to its automated features, but you should still perform manual reviews just to be sure.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Proofread all website copy:</span></h4>



<p>Proofreading is vital for any website copy published since it directly affects brand reputation. You can use browser extensions such as <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grammarly</a> to speed up the proofreading process. However, you should still check your site’s copy manually by going through all of the content.</p>



<h2>Post-Launch</h2>



<p>At this point, we’ve already gone through most of the tips in our launch checklist and are ready for your launch date. So, this means that you can now launch your redesigned site for all the world to see!</p>



<p>From here, the next step is to ensure that everything is working as intended after the website has been published live. Here are the things you need to do:</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Monitor your site analytics:</span></h4>



<p>As a continuation after setting up the website’s analytics, you want to ensure that all of the data you need is coming in successfully. The information that you receive from Google Analytics is essential for you to know if each aspect of your site is working as intended.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Check links to third-party sites:</span></h4>



<p>You want to make sure that any external links you have directing people to third-party websites have been updated and are viewable. The <a href="/blog/website-navigation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website navigation</a> experience of your users will suffer if you have links, such as that to your social channels and other relevant sites, which lead to different pages or dead ends.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Announce the new website launch:</span></h4>



<p>If everything is working as intended, you can finally let your users or customers know about your newly-launched website. Your website is live, and all of your hard work should pay off in the coming months.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="663" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Launch-alerts-1.jpg" alt="Launch alerts 1" class="wp-image-30193" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Launch-alerts-1.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Launch-alerts-1-300x194.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Launch-alerts-1-768x497.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Launch-alerts-1-24x16.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Launch-alerts-1-36x23.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Launch-alerts-1-48x31.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>WordPress is, by far, the most popular CMS in the world. It&#8217;s also among the most secure.</p>



<p>That might not be obvious, considering how many articles you read about security attacks against WordPress websites. The truth is, when you power more than <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40% of the world&#8217;s websites</a>, you&#8217;re bound to be a target.</p>



<p>Given that exposure, WordPress has an impressive array of potential protections. However, the many moving parts that come together to create a website can still create security flaws.</p>

<p>So yes, WordPress can be secure. But how protected your website and backend data actually is depends on how actively you manage your security settings and the plan you have in place to prevent and mitigate attacks.</p>



<p>Inevitably, some WordPress security vulnerabilities will pop up over time. In a world where <a href="https://techjury.net/blog/how-many-cyber-attacks-per-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30,000 websites are hacked </a>every single day, that&#8217;s almost inevitable.</p>



<p>The key to successful website management, then, is making sure you understand potential flaws and put the plans in place to protect against them. On WordPress, that process is relatively simple—as long as you know where to look and how to fix the most common issues. You’ve lucked out; that&#8217;s exactly what we&#8217;ll cover in this guide.</p>

</div><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">Chapter 1</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">Vulnerability 1: Login Security</h2></div></div>



<p>You, and anyone with access to edit your website&#8217;s backend, have logins. How secure those logins are plays a major role in keeping your website safe and secure.</p>



<h3>What is it?</h3>



<p>The safety of your admin logins is perhaps the most straightforward security issue with WordPress. Because this CMS is so widely-used, the admin login screen (which is identical for all websites on the platform) is an easy target for malicious users.</p>



<p>Most commonly, your login security is compromised because of so-called &#8220;brute force&#8221; attacks. Here&#8217;s how <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/brute-force-attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cybersecurity firm Kaspersky describes </a>this old-but-proven hacking method:</p>



<p>A brute force attack uses trial-and-error to guess login info, encryption keys, or find a hidden web page. Hackers work through all possible combinations hoping to guess correctly. These attacks are done by &#8216;brute force&#8217; meaning they use excessive forceful attempts to try and &#8216;force&#8217; their way into your private account(s).<br>In other words, hackers build a script that goes through millions of potential username and password combinations in the fraction of a second. Once they get lucky, the script notes the codes that got them there, providing easy access through the front door.</p>



<p>Your login security isn&#8217;t always compromised through brute force, though. Easy-to-guess admin passwords (<a href="https://www.safetydetectives.com/blog/the-most-hacked-passwords-in-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here&#8217;s a list</a>) can allow access to anyone who&#8217;s willing to give it a shot. Once they&#8217;re in, they&#8217;ll be able to see and edit anything that you can.</p>



<h3>How do you fix it?</h3>



<p>Fortunately, the solution to this security flaw is pretty simple: improve your passwords. Even sophisticated brute force attacks will have trouble guessing unpredictable passwords that are made of multiple character types. Strong passwords with combinations of letters, numbers, and special characters make it more difficult for hackers to break into your site.</p>



<p>This <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/195430/how-to-create-a-strong-password-and-remember-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guide on creating a strong password</a> is a great resource to get started. Do it right, and it will take even a brute force algorithm years to crack it. And if all of that gets too complex for your own good, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/password-managers-a-little-pain-for-a-lot-better-security-world-password-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using a password manager </a>can help you keep track and stay strong.</p>



<p>You can take a few other steps, as well. <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/article/two-step-authentication/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Two-step authentication</a> makes your admin passwords impossible to crack. You might also want to get rid of your standard &#8220;admin&#8221; account, which tends to be first in line for an admin attack. With a two-step or two factor authentication it helps to make sure that only authorized people are able to gain access to your site.</p>



<p>Another suggestion is to limit those who have access to your website in the first place. This cuts down on the number of accounts that hackers can take over in order to gain access. Plus limiting the number of admin users helps to cut down on the amount of access and power each admin user has.</p>



<p>For extra protection give you WordPress login and update through the use of a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-limit-login-attempts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress plugin</a> you can limit login attempts and increase your WordPress security (just be careful of the plugins used as noted in our next section.) This ultimately can keep your WordPress site safer from hackers using brute force attacks to guess your password. Also limit login attempts for specific administrative roles/positions within the website &#8211; the higher the role/position the more security needed!</p>



<div class="ChapterFullwidth" style="background-image:url(https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-form">

</div><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">Chapter 2</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">Vulnerability 2: Outdated Software or Plugins</h2></div></div>



<p>You&#8217;ll often hear WordPress and cybersecurity experts lament the dangers of plugin. Let&#8217;s not forget that plugins can be great in the right usage, but they do need to be managed to avoid security risks.</p>



<h3>What is it?</h3>



<p>WordPress updates frequently. Generally speaking, we recommend checking for updates at least once every month. If you stop updating your core software, you risk opening your site up to security flaws and security vulnerabilities that the updates are specifically designed to solve.</p>



<p>The same is true for plugins, which are a convenient backdoor for hackers if the core software is well-protected. If you don&#8217;t check for updates frequently, you could open yourself up for WordPress vulnerabilities and common WordPress security issues.</p>



<p>Ignore these updates, and your website becomes vulnerable. Malicious users now have access to your backend code, which they can use to install malware or trackers that ultimately compromise your data.</p>



<h3>How do you fix it?</h3>



<p>The easy answer is making sure that both your core WordPress software and your WordPress plugins and themes are always up to date. Here&#8217;s how you can achieve that.</p>



<p>Within your WordPress system, navigate to the Updates tab, which gives you an easy overview of what needs to be updated, and what&#8217;s already on the latest version. You can also check for updates with the click of a button, and see the timestamp for the last time you performed that check.</p>



<p>Updates for your Plugins will show up in the Plugins tab in the same system. You&#8217;ll need to update them individually, which can take some time.</p>



<p>Check both tabs frequently. Once a month is a good cadence, but there are no penalties for more regular checks. Reserve some time to run the updates, making sure you never run into time crunches with other adjustments or admin tasks at the same time.</p>



<div class="ChapterFullwidth" style="background-image:url(https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-form">
<a id="chapter 3"></a>
</div><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">Chapter 3</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">Vulnerability 3: Malware</h2></div></div>



<p>You&#8217;ve probably heard the term as a thing to avoid. But what is it, and how can you avoid it? Let&#8217;s dig into malware as a common WordPress security vulnerability.</p>



<h3>What is it?</h3>



<p>Malware is short for &#8220;malicious software.&#8221; It exists as a threat in anything related to coding and technology. In websites specifically, it&#8217;s most commonly a few lines of codes that get smuggled into your website specifically to track and send out reports on sensitive data you&#8217;d rather keep to yourself.</p>



<p>Malware can steal credit card information on your e-commerce site. It can check for customer logins or begin to follow your website users around to other destinations. It can even be used to spam your site&#8217;s content.</p>



<p>In other words, it&#8217;s not necessarily the type of parasite you want to let in.</p>



<h3>How do you fix it?</h3>



<p>The most common reason malware finds its way onto WordPress websites are outdated plugins and themes, and we&#8217;ve already covered those above. But we should also mention that some plugins come with malware built-in. Naturally, you want to avoid those.</p>



<p>That means you need to be judicious with any plugin that makes its way to your site. In its <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plugin directory</a>, WordPress lists basic information about each of its 58,000+ options, including basic security information. That&#8217;s a great start.</p>



<p>It also helps to work with a development partner who can vet plugins more thoroughly on your behalf. Generally speaking, it&#8217;s better to pay a bit extra for a well-vetted plugin than get one for free that comes with an unhelpful, hidden malware addition.<br>It&#8217;s not enough to be mindful in the beginning, though. It also helps to regularly run one of many available <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/website/wordpress-security-scan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress security scanners</a> that can help you find and remove malware.</p>



<div class="ChapterFullwidth" style="background-image:url(https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-form">
<a id="chapter 4"></a>
</div><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">Chapter 4</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">Vulnerability 4: Phishing</h2></div></div>



<p>The name is somewhat self-explanatory, if you ignore the ph it starts with for a second. A phishing attack includes hackers literally fishing for personal information from your customers, using your website&#8217;s vulnerabilities.</p>



<h3>What is it?</h3>



<p>Here&#8217;s how phishing tends to work: through a vulnerability in your website&#8217;s code, a malicious user gains access to your contact database of website visitors. They use that contact information to send out countless emails pretending to be something else.</p>



<p>The message itself will contain a link promising a resolution or reward of some kind. Once the user clicks on it, malware installs on their computer or browser, and their information (including credit card information) is exposed to theft.</p>



<p>You&#8217;ve come across, or at least heard about this. Think Nigerian prince, social security scams, etc. <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-releases-the-internet-crime-complaint-center-2020-internet-crime-report-including-covid-19-scam-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to the FBI</a>, phishing is the most common type of cyberattack today.</p>



<p>Most users won&#8217;t fall for it. But if even one percent does, the phishers can claim success.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s the problem: when phishing happens through your website and/or WordPress admin account, the attackers present themselves as representing you or your business. Users who fall for it will likely never trust you again. But even for those who recognize it as invalid, your credibility might be severely compromised.</p>



<h3>How do you fix it?</h3>



<p>Because phishing relies on coding and malware within your system, the fix here is similar to some of the steps we&#8217;ve mentioned above. Use secure passwords, regularly update your platform and plugins, and run periodic security checks.</p>



<p>You can also do more. For instance, consider using <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/how-to-add-recaptcha-to-wordpress-comment-form/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">technology like ReCAPTCHA</a> as another security solution, which can prevent bots from posting phishing messages in your comments. If you do get exposed to a phishing attack, a fast reaction to secure your website and let your users know not to click on specific links, can mitigate some damage.</p>



<div class="ChapterFullwidth" style="background-image:url(https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-form">
<a id="chapter 5"></a>
</div><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">Chapter 5</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">Vulnerability 5: DoS Attacks</h2></div></div>



<p>In a way, it&#8217;s somewhat like brute force. When hackers attack your website through a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, they try to overwhelm it with sheer volume. The results can be devastating.</p>



<h3>What is it?</h3>



<p>Hackers engaging in a DoS attack send so much bot traffic to your website that your server can&#8217;t handle it. The site crashes, preventing both you and your audience from accessing it until the problem is taken care of.</p>



<p>Unlike the other security vulnerabilities mentioned so far, DoS attack focus not on your website, but the server on which it sits. No server can handle an infinite amount of traffic, and the aim is to break it down so that the website has no foundation to stand on.<br>As a result, DoS attacks don&#8217;t harm your website&#8217;s code or sensitive data. They simply bring its infrastructure to its knees. Of course, you&#8217;ll lose revenue and credibility in the process, especially since your users won&#8217;t know what happened and simply think your website no longer exists until it&#8217;s fixed.</p>



<h3>How do you fix it?</h3>



<p>Because DoS attacks aim at your website&#8217;s server, finding the right host is key to preventing them. That server, ideally, should have some basic measures (such as a strong firewall) in place to prevent simple attacks.</p>



<p>Beyond the credibility and security of the host itself, it also helps to plan with more bandwidth than you think you&#8217;ll need. If your website can withstand an unexpected amount of traffic, you&#8217;ll be prepared not just for an increase in customers over time but also the sudden increase that comes with simple attacks.</p>



<p>Even both of these steps may not completely secure you against DoS attacks. That&#8217;s why the final step is building a DoS response plan. <br>Learn to spot early warning signs, such as spotty connectivity or random page load slowdowns. It also helps to have a backup plan in place to respond to an attack, which might include anything from notifications to your internal and external audiences, and the potential move to a new server should the DoS attack subsist.</p>



<div class="ChapterFullwidth" style="background-image:url(https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-form">
<a id="chapter 6"></a>
</div><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">Chapter 6</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">Vulnerability 6: SEO Spam</h2></div></div>



<p>Finally, let&#8217;s talk about the dark side of SEO. As much as we love optimizing websites to rank highly on search engines, the strategy can be exploited by malicious actors through SEO spam.</p>



<h3>What is it?</h3>



<p>You know the typical <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/black-hat-seo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">black hat SEO strategies</a>, like link spamming and keyword stuffing? Google finds and punishes them pretty effectively these days. Of course, that&#8217;s not helpful if it&#8217;s being done specifically to hurt your website&#8217;s SEO efforts.</p>



<p>SEO spammers do exactly that. They use malware to change code and content on your website to prompt Google to punish it. That might include filling the site with bad keywords, linking to and from low-credibility websites, and even creating pop-ups that worsen user experience and hide valuable content.</p>



<p>It can get worse. Advanced SEO spammers can use your hard-earned rankings to sell their own questionable merchandise. Once Google notices, your website (not theirs) will get the punishment.</p>



<p>Over time, the results can be devastating. <a href="https://medium.com/@SearchDecoder/18-eye-opening-seo-statistics-to-prove-the-value-of-organic-search-ff1b19aade40#:~:text=51%25%20OF%20WEBSITE%20TRAFFIC%20COMES%20FROM%20ORGANIC%20SEARCH%20RESULTS&amp;text=According%20to%20a%20study%20conducted%20by%20BrightEdge%2C%20this%20means%20that,and%20paid%20search%20just%2010%25." target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to one study</a>, 50% of organic traffic and 40% of revenue comes from organic search engine results. Imagine the devastation to your online pipeline if Google begins pushing your page down to lower rankings and pages in its results pages.</p>



<h3>How do you fix it?</h3>



<p>SEO spammers largely operate through malware, so updated software and regular security checks can help here as well. That&#8217;s the basic start.</p>



<p>Beyond that, it also helps to closely monitor your search results and SEO efforts. If your strategy isn&#8217;t changing but you&#8217;re suddenly seeing decreases in search traffic, something is up that you might want to check out.</p>



<p>Finally, secure yourself against the most basic form of SEO spam: links to your site from questionable pages. Regularly <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2648487?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disavowing bad backlinks</a> can help you keep that library clean and stay on the good side of Google.</p>



<div class="ChapterFullwidth" style="background-image:url(https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-form">

<p>Generally speaking, WordPress is about as secure as could be expected from the world&#8217;s largest CMS platform. Still, as with any platform, there are some security vulnerabilities that you&#8217;ll want to stay ahead of.</p>



<p>Simply put, there is no such thing as too much security. It never hurts to snuff out potential threats long before they become actual problems that impact your revenue.</p>



<p>Fortunately, taking the right steps is relatively simple. The solutions described throughout this guide don&#8217;t just apply to these specific types of attacks.</p>



<p>Creating complex passwords, keeping your software and plugins up to date, and running regular security checks is never a bad idea. Neither is making sure you use a secure host for your website.</p>



<p>After all, you want that peace of mind. You want to maintain your credibility and grow your revenue. By making security a regular part of your website administration, you can accomplish just that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As a business, you make some decisions because they benefit your customers, while others are designed to protect your business legally. Building an ADA-compliant website falls into both categories.</p>



<span id="more-29702"></span>



<p>According to the CDC, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/infographic-disability-impacts-all.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 60 million Americans</a> live with some type of disability. That&#8217;s more than one in four adults. According to <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/disability#:~:text=Results-,One%20billion%20people%2C%20or%2015%25%20of%20the%20world's%20population%2C,million%20people%2C%20experience%20significant%20disabilities." target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Bank estimates</a>, that number rises to one billion around the world. Following relevant disability guidelines ensures that your website is as relevant and beneficial to them as it would be to any other potential customer or client.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s one incentive. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) also makes building an accessible website a legal necessity. While it doesn&#8217;t technically mention websites as part of its language, they have been deemed &#8220;places of public accommodations&#8221; under the law by a wide range of court rulings. Compliance is crucial to avoid potential lawsuits or settlements.</p>



<p>Making your web content accessible, in turn, means following WCAG, which is short for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. More specifically, <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/glance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WCAG 2.1</a> is a set of individual rules that ensure your website is accessible for users with any type of disability.</p>



<p>So let&#8217;s dive in. Keep reading to learn not just why your business needs to care about ADA and WCAG but also how you can accomplish an ADA compliant site —with one option that might be simpler than you thought.</p>

<h5 id="chapter1" style="text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: 2px; color: #ec4067;">Chapter 1:</h5>
<h2 style="color: #ffffff;">Why is ADA Compliance Important?</h2>
</div>



<p>We&#8217;ll explain the basics, but there’s always more to learn. ADA compliance has serious business benefits, not in the least because a significant portion of your users will appreciate it.</p>



<h3>What is Website compliance?</h3>



<p>First, we need to ask ourselves “What is website compliance?” Website compliance is described as “the state of observing and following all accessibility laws and regulations that apply to your website – should be an overall goal for your organization” by <a href="https://www.essentialaccessibility.com/blog/how-to-ensure-website-compliance-accessibility-standards#:~:text=Web%20compliance%20%E2%80%93%20the%20state%20of,overall%20goal%20for%20your%20organization." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Essential Accessibility.com</a>. One of these accessibility laws is Title II and Title III of the ADA which states that persons with disabilities cannot be discriminated against on the basis of their disability. By making your website and web content accessible this allows for equal access for all people.</p>



<div class="hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed" style="width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 640px; max-height: 310px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;">
<div class="hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 48.44%; margin: 0;"><iframe class="hs-responsive-embed-iframe" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/548848871?color=D41756&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="640" height="310" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-service="vimeo"></iframe></div>
</div>



<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Above is an example of our favorite ADA website compliance tool in action on our client Ag America&#8217;s website.</span></p>



<h3>Who does ADA Web Compliance Apply to?</h3>



<p>Under Title III of the ADA concerns public businesses while under Title II it specifically describes accessible websites and public accommodation. Meaning businesses must be able to serve people with disabilities by providing them access to web content in accommodating ways.</p>



<p>In terms of the World Wide Web, places of public accommodation would make businesses are responsible and to make sure their digital content follows best practices through the forms of mobile apps, webpages, any links, etc.</p>



<h3>Is ADA Compliance Mandatory for Websites?</h3>



<p>The technical answer to this question is “not necessarily” under federal, however, under local and state government there must be accessible websites. From both a legal and ethical point of view should offer web accessibility services through their websites as there are a number of benefits for doing so.<br>The best way of offering public accommodation is through following WCAG guidelines to create web accessibility for all. The success criteria will be shared later on but follow the guidelines laid out in WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1 will help to make your website accessible and avoid legal action such as lawsuits.</p>



<h3>The User Benefits of Website Compliance</h3>



<p>We&#8217;ve established already just how common disabilities actually are in the general population. Millions of people might have trouble recognizing certain colors, reading small type, or seeing any of your visual content. Others might have limited use of their hands, increasing their difficulty to navigate around your site.</p>



<p>The general term for software that helps these users navigate the web is typically called assistive technology. It can include a wide range of platforms, including:</p>



<ul><li>Screen readers</li><li>Eye tracking tools</li><li>Automatic contrast adjustments</li><li>Speech recognition software</li><li>And much more.</li></ul>



<p>Globally, this is a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200713005395/en/Global-Disabled-and-Elderly-Assistive-Technology-Industry-2020-to-2027---Market-Trajectory-Analytics---ResearchAndMarkets.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$21 billion industry</a> that is expected to top $31 billion by 2027. The rapid growth is only natural, considering how increasingly important the internet has become around the globe.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll get into the exact question of what makes an ADA accessible website below. For now, the most important takeaway is that a website following WCAG and ADA guidelines is specifically designed for all common disabilities, and the technology accommodating them. It ensures that your website is just as beneficial for them as it is for all other segments of your audience.</p>



<p>Think about the opportunities that it brings, depending on the audience you target. A retailer targeting older populations might improve the online experience of more than 50% of its audience. But even a beauty brand, whose audience might skew younger, will still encounter users with disabilities who will appreciate the accommodations.</p>



<p>In short, visitors will appreciate a user interface that accommodates their needs, rather than forcing them to adjust to yours.</p>



<h3>The Business Benefits of ADA Compliance</h3>



<p>Those user benefits above, of course, are not purely philanthropic. Through making your website accessible by accommodating the needs of audiences with disabilities, you unlock the goodwill and purchase ability of one quarter of your target audience. That figure rises significantly depending on your target audience&#8217;s demographics.</p>



<p>This is an audience with an estimated disposable income above $600 billion. Its goodwill can easily translate to increased revenues for your business.<br>The connection between user and business advantages, as outlined above, is natural. But ADA compliance benefits your business even beyond happier, more approachable page visitors.</p>



<p>The most obvious business benefit is avoiding legal jeopardy, such as violating Title III. According to one analysis, 2019 saw <a href="https://www.adatitleiii.com/2020/02/2019-was-another-record-breaking-year-for-federal-ada-title-iii-lawsuits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 11,000 lawsuits</a> related to ADA Title III violations. Over the past five years, that number has grown by an average of more than 20%.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not just large or small businesses, either. Brands as well-known as Domino&#8217;s and the Golden State Warriors have been sued because their websites weren&#8217;t ADA accessible in recent years.</p>



<p>Finally, it&#8217;s a reputation issue. A lawsuit, or even a reputation for not sufficiently catering to audiences with unique needs can be as harmful as a reputation for the opposite can be beneficial. Especially in highly regulated industries of public-private partnerships, ADA compliance becomes a business benefit and potential differentiator from your competition.</p>



<p>So much for the why. Next, we&#8217;ll explore the how of creating site-wide ADA compliance.</p>

<h2 style="color: #ffffff;">What, Exactly, Makes Your Websites ADA-Compliant?</h2>
</div>



<p>In almost every instance, lawsuits and judges, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, have all pointed to a simple way to make sure that your webpages are ADA compliant: follow the WCAG guidelines.</p>



<p>So let&#8217;s dig in. First published by the University of Wisconsin-Madison, they&#8217;ve been continually updated to account for new research, web developments, and the current digital landscape. The most recent WCAG 2.1 prompts websites to follow guidelines in 4 categories, with the acronym POUR:</p>



<ul><li>Perceivable</li><li>Operable</li><li>Understandable</li><li>Robust</li></ul>



<div class="wr-cta-container">
<div class="wr-cta-container-left"><strong>Protip</strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of them deserves further explanation. We have actionable tips from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/glance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WCAG&#8217;s quick guide</a> to achieve success in each category</p>
</div>
</div>



<h3>Perceivable</h3>



<p>Users with disabilities should be able to experience your webpages to its fullest success criteria. They might not be able to see the text, images, or video, so it&#8217;s all about providing alternative ways to consume your website&#8217;s individual pages.</p>



<h4>How to Make Your Websites Perceivable</h4>



<ul><li>Create ALT text for any non-text content on your site. That ALT text should describe the media in simple words.</li><li>Anytime multimedia like video appears on your site, provide captions for users with hearing disabilities.</li><li>Create your text in a way that accounts for assistive technologies like screen readers. That includes actions like following a predictable intro-text-conclusion structure and avoiding text on images.</li><li>Use color as a nonessential design choice, ensuring that color-blind users can still navigate your site. For instance, a green button is not enough to convey &#8216;go&#8217; without the word &#8216;go&#8217;.</li></ul>



<p>Ensure that audio playing on your site is nonessential and can be controlled rather than auto-playing on your website.</p>



<h3>Operable</h3>



<p>This principle is simple: all users, regardless of any devices they might use, should be able to navigate your website and all features you have to offer them. In other words, no part of your UI should negatively impact UX, regardless of disabilities or assistive technologies used.</p>



<h4>How to Make Your Websites Operable</h4>



<ul><li>Make sure that your website can be navigated with only a keyboard.<br>Make sure that alternative inputs, like voice recognition or mouse only, are just as smooth.</li><li>Give users enough time to read and consume the content, avoiding tight time limits or fast autoscrolling.</li><li>Avoid any content that could cause seizures or audiovisual confusion.</li><li>Provide navigation assistance, through intuitive menus and alternative ways to navigate (such as an internal site search).</li></ul>



<h3>Understandable</h3>



<p>This one is self-explanatory. Users with disabilities should be able to understand all content on your website as anyone else would. That includes both the main content and any instructions for additional tools on your site such as your navigation, search, or forms.</p>



<h4>How to Make Your Websites Understandable</h4>



<ul><li>Clarify the language of any page in its header HTML tag.<br>Avoid overuse of unusual terms such as jargon and idioms, which assistive technology may not be able to identify.</li><li>Make your content and navigation predictable, keeping it consistent throughout your website.</li></ul>



<p>Use labels, instructions, and error correction tools to help users with disabilities avoid and correct both their own mistakes and website errors.</p>



<h3>Robust</h3>



<p>Finally, an ADA-compliant website is robust in that it creates the same comprehensive experience for users with disabilities who need assistive technologies as it would for anyone else. In other words, compatibility with any tools a portion of your visitors might use is key to be compliant within this section.</p>



<h4>How to Make Your Websites Robust</h4>



<ul><li>Optimize HTML and any markup languages to create complete tags, avoid duplicates, and keep ID&#8217;s unique.</li><li>Ensure that all UI components have names and roles that can be determined programmatically and directly in the code.</li><li>Use status messages to provide feedback when users take sufficient action, such as a “success” message when someone fills out a form.</li></ul>



<p>Combine all techniques within the POUR acronym, and you get quite the complex web of needs to be truly WCAG 2.1 and ADA-compliant. The complete guide on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=413#principle1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WCAG website provides examples</a> and tips for each of the 50+ individual guidelines within those four overarching categories.</p>

<h2 style="color: #ffffff;">Introducing Our Secret Weapon for ADA Compliance</h2>
</div>



<p>You might be forgiven for getting just a bit nervous after reading the previous section. After all, one thing is clear: ADA website compliance is not an easy thing to accomplish. Done manually, it can consume your entire web development budget and resources—and even then, you still might miss a few steps and remain in legal jeopardy.</p>



<p>Fortunately, it doesn&#8217;t need to be a manual process. Allow us to introduce our secret weapon: <a href="https://accessibe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AccessiBe</a>, an accessibility tool that can make your website ADA compliant much more dynamically.</p>



<p>Gal Vizel, AccessiBe’s CEO spoke of his company in saying &#8220;We know that business owners do not knowingly want to leave their consumers out, not from their shops and not from their websites. AccessiBe makes website accessibility achievable for websites of all sizes so that people with disabilities can have access to a wider range of services, goods, products, and opportunities. We&#8217;re bridging the website accessibility gap, getting people with disabilities closer to the reality of an accessible web and to be able to use the web the way it was intended.&#8221;</p>



<h3>What is AccessiBe?</h3>



<p>The tool is simple: one line of JavaScript, added to your website. Once there, your website gains an accessibility interface that users with disabilities can use for features like zooming in, reading the screen, and enabling keyboard-based navigation.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a simple icon that users can click on to expand. Of course, that icon can be customized in both colors and placement to conform to your brand and website layout. From there, the interface helps any users with disabilities more easily navigate and experience your site.</p>



<p>That interface, though, is only the start of a more accessible experience. The rest happens in the background, with an automatic AI-based scan of your website that catches and corrects errors on an ongoing basis. Within 48 hours, your website is accessible and compliant —and it will stay that way as long as the tool is installed in your code.</p>



<p>AccessiBe&#8217;s goal is to make the entire internet accessible for users with disabilities by 2025. It&#8217;s ambitious, but based on this tool&#8217;s capabilities, it doesn&#8217;t seem out of the realm of possibility.</p>

<h5 id="chapter4" style="text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: 2px; color: #ec4067;">Chapter 4:</h5>
<h2 style="color: #ffffff;">How AccessiBe Can Help Your Website Succeed</h2>
</div>



<p>Now, here’s how you get things started. AccessiBe can help your website get and stay compliant within the POUR acronym described above.</p>



<ul><li>Perceivable: the tool scans your website and adds ALT text to any images missing it. It can also provide captions and, through its integrated screen reader, optimize text to match it.</li><li>Operable: the tool optimizes and completes coding to allow for alternative inputs, including the correct tagging of links, popups, navigational menus, and more.</li><li>Understandable: Navigation and labels get fixed up in the code of the site itself, and jargon and technical terms are flagged as needed.</li><li>Robust: the tool&#8217;s contextual machine learning allows for continuous optimization of HTML within the site, including correction of labels of any core UI components.</li></ul>



<p>AccessiBe&#8217;s <a href="https://accessibe.com/product/artificial-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">artificial intelligence page</a> further explains the process and various ways it can help you become and remain compliant with all relevant accessibility guidelines. The result is a truly optimized website that ultimately improves your user interface experience, regardless of its needs and challenges.</p>

<h2 style="color: #ffffff;">Next Steps to an ADA-Compliant Website</h2>
</div>



<p>So much for our secret weapon. But what, exactly, should you do to truly reach ADA site compliance? We suggest a few core steps that can help you get there:</p>



<ul><li>Complete a <a href="https://ace.accessibe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">site accessibility audit</a>. That gives you a great idea of where your business stands and where your website needs improvements.</li><li>Research the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and WCAG trends in your industry. While this guide works great as an introduction, plenty of industry and audience-specific nuances exist. The more familiar you are with them, the better.Talk to your legal team. Whether you have your own legal department or work with an external lawyer, an expert can give you a good perspective on the importance of ADA compliance.</li><li>Look for a website partner. Especially if going through the process on your own is daunting, finding a partner can go a long way towards calming your worries.</li><li>Leverage the right tools (Yep, this is where we mention AccessiBe again.) Knowing the tools at your disposal can help you act quickly to make your website accessible.</li></ul>



<p>Ultimately, ADA compliance benefits everyone. It improves your website&#8217;s user experience and unlocks a significant part of your target audience. As a result, your potential revenue and profitability rises accordingly. And of course, you ease the worries of company leadership by decreasing legal liabilities, while simultaneously improving your reputation as an accessible, compliant business.<br>And, once you break it down, it&#8217;s not as daunting as it appears at first. At the end of the day, you’ll likely feel similar to countless other businesses addressing this demand. You&#8217;ll want to make your website&#8217;s ADA-compliance a priority.</p>

<p>Do you ever think about how convenient the supermarket is?</p>



<p>Everything is in one place. You don&#8217;t have to go to the milk farm to get milk, the chicken farm to get eggs, or the farmer&#8217;s market to get vegetables anymore.</p>



<p>The amount of time you spend shopping is so much lower because you only need to visit one Shopify store.</p>



<p>Google Tag Manager is like that, but for your Shopify stores. It loads all the external scripts (tags) your Shopify theme&nbsp;uses in one request instead of making seventeen different requests.</p>



<p>Think tracking codes, analytics, etc.</p>



<p>Google Tag Manager also loads JavaScript files asynchronously so that they don&#8217;t force other elements of the page to wait for them to finish. It looks like this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="890" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/JS-LOADING-2-1024x890-1.jpg" alt="JS LOADING 2 1024x890 1" class="wp-image-29998" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/JS-LOADING-2-1024x890-1.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/JS-LOADING-2-1024x890-1-300x261.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/JS-LOADING-2-1024x890-1-768x668.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/JS-LOADING-2-1024x890-1-24x21.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/JS-LOADING-2-1024x890-1-36x31.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/JS-LOADING-2-1024x890-1-48x42.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>But don’t take our word for it—Airbnb <a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/gtm-casestudy-airbnb.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increased their site’s page speed by 8%</a> (and got a better insight into their analytics) after they used Google Tag Manager.</p>



<p>Here’s how to get set up to speed up your Shopify stores:</p>



<h3>Step #1. Create a Google Tag Manager account</h3>



<p>First, open up <a href="https://tagmanager.google.com/">Google Tag Manager</a>.</p>



<p>You’ll see a screen like this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="325" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-home-1024x325-1.png" alt="google tag manager home 1024x325 1" class="wp-image-28680" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-home-1024x325-1.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-home-1024x325-1-300x95.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-home-1024x325-1-768x244.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-home-1024x325-1-24x8.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-home-1024x325-1-36x11.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-home-1024x325-1-48x15.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Click &#8220;Create Account&#8221; to create an account with GTM.</p>



<p>On the next screen, you’ll need to fill out some information:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="820" height="675" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-new-account.png" alt="google tag manager new account" class="wp-image-28716" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-new-account.png 820w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-new-account-300x247.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-new-account-768x632.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-new-account-24x20.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-new-account-36x30.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-new-account-48x40.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px" /></figure>



<p>Then click &#8220;create.&#8221; (Don’t forget to agree to the GDPR conditions checkbox!)</p>



<p>After that, you’ll arrive at a new dashboard where a lightbox with your Google Tag Manager tracking code will appear. Ours looks like this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="713" height="489" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-tracking-code.png" alt="google tag manager tracking code" class="wp-image-28469" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-tracking-code.png 713w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-tracking-code-300x206.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-tracking-code-24x16.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-tracking-code-36x25.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-tracking-code-48x33.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px" /></figure>



<p>Keep this tab open! You&#8217;ll refer to it in the next step.</p>



<h3>Step #2. Paste the Google Tag Manager Code in Shopify</h3>



<p>(A little scared of editing code? Don’t be. We&#8217;ve got you.)</p>



<p>In a different window, go to your Shopify admin portal (should be yourstore.shopify.com/admin).</p>



<p>Navigate to your Shopify Theme menu on the left-hand sidebar (Sales Channels → Online Store → Themes).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="228" height="250" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-nav-themes.png" alt="shopify nav themes" class="wp-image-28572" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-nav-themes.png 228w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-nav-themes-22x24.png 22w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-nav-themes-33x36.png 33w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-nav-themes-44x48.png 44w" sizes="(max-width: 228px) 100vw, 228px" /></figure>



<p>From there, select &#8220;Actions,&#8221; then &#8220;Edit code&#8221;:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="621" height="412" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-themes-edit-code.png" alt="shopify themes edit code" class="wp-image-28730" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-themes-edit-code.png 621w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-themes-edit-code-300x199.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-themes-edit-code-24x16.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-themes-edit-code-36x24.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-themes-edit-code-48x32.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px" /></figure>



<p>You need to paste the first Google Tag Manage code block into <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of the &#8220;theme.liquid&#8221; and &#8220;checkout.liquid&#8221; files.</p>



<p>First, find your &#8220;theme.liquid&#8221; file.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="269" height="160" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-find-theme-liquid-file.png" alt="shopify find theme liquid file" class="wp-image-28674" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-find-theme-liquid-file.png 269w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-find-theme-liquid-file-24x14.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-find-theme-liquid-file-36x21.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-find-theme-liquid-file-48x29.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 269px) 100vw, 269px" /></figure>



<p>Click on the file name to open the code in the right editor.</p>



<p>Look for the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> HTML tag.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="680" height="356" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-theme-liquid-find-head-section.png" alt="shopify theme liquid find head section" class="wp-image-28614" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-theme-liquid-find-head-section.png 680w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-theme-liquid-find-head-section-300x157.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-theme-liquid-find-head-section-24x13.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-theme-liquid-find-head-section-36x19.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-theme-liquid-find-head-section-48x25.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Now all you have to do is paste your Google Tag Manager code.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="713" height="489" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Install-Google-Tag-Manager-Snippet-head-block-code.png" alt="Install Google Tag Manager Snippet head block code" class="wp-image-28754" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Install-Google-Tag-Manager-Snippet-head-block-code.png 713w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Install-Google-Tag-Manager-Snippet-head-block-code-300x206.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Install-Google-Tag-Manager-Snippet-head-block-code-24x16.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Install-Google-Tag-Manager-Snippet-head-block-code-36x25.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Install-Google-Tag-Manager-Snippet-head-block-code-48x33.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px" /></figure>



<p>When you’re done, your code should look something like this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="693" height="220" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gtm-code-in-liquid-theme-file-shopify.png" alt="gtm code in liquid theme file shopify" class="wp-image-28437" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gtm-code-in-liquid-theme-file-shopify.png 693w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gtm-code-in-liquid-theme-file-shopify-300x95.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gtm-code-in-liquid-theme-file-shopify-24x8.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gtm-code-in-liquid-theme-file-shopify-36x11.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gtm-code-in-liquid-theme-file-shopify-48x15.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 693px) 100vw, 693px" /></figure>



<p>Now you need to copy the second block of code into the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> section of &#8220;theme.liquid.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="713" height="489" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Install-Google-Tag-Manager-Snippet-body-block-code.png" alt="Install Google Tag Manager Snippet body block code" class="wp-image-28359" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Install-Google-Tag-Manager-Snippet-body-block-code.png 713w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Install-Google-Tag-Manager-Snippet-body-block-code-300x206.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Install-Google-Tag-Manager-Snippet-body-block-code-24x16.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Install-Google-Tag-Manager-Snippet-body-block-code-36x25.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Install-Google-Tag-Manager-Snippet-body-block-code-48x33.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px" /></figure>



<p>You’ll find the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag the same way you found the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag.</p>



<p>When you’re done, your code should look something like this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="688" height="289" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gtm-code-in-liquid-theme-body.png" alt="gtm code in liquid theme body" class="wp-image-28570" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gtm-code-in-liquid-theme-body.png 688w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gtm-code-in-liquid-theme-body-300x126.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gtm-code-in-liquid-theme-body-24x10.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gtm-code-in-liquid-theme-body-36x15.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gtm-code-in-liquid-theme-body-48x20.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 688px) 100vw, 688px" /></figure>



<p>Click &#8220;Save.&#8221;</p>



<p>Now repeat this exact process for the &#8220;checkout.liquid&#8221; file.</p>



<p>Once you save, you’re done!</p>



<p>Now that you’re set up, it’s time to actually use Google Tag Manager.</p>



<h3>Step #3. Adding Tags in Google Tag Manager</h3>



<p>First, go to <a href="https://tagmanager.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Tag Manager</a> and select the container you created back in Step 1.</p>



<p>On your dashboard, click “Add Tag.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="297" height="170" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-add-new-tag.png" alt="google tag manager add new tag" class="wp-image-28534" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-add-new-tag.png 297w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-add-new-tag-24x14.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-add-new-tag-36x21.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-add-new-tag-48x27.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 297px) 100vw, 297px" /></figure>



<p>Now you get the option to add either a tag or a trigger. Click the top block—the Tag Configuration—to add a new tag.</p>



<p>You’ll see a sidebar like this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="317" height="684" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-add-new-tag-choose-tag-tyoe.png" alt="google tag manager add new tag choose tag tyoe" class="wp-image-28480" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-add-new-tag-choose-tag-tyoe.png 317w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-add-new-tag-choose-tag-tyoe-139x300.png 139w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-add-new-tag-choose-tag-tyoe-11x24.png 11w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-add-new-tag-choose-tag-tyoe-17x36.png 17w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-add-new-tag-choose-tag-tyoe-22x48.png 22w" sizes="(max-width: 317px) 100vw, 317px" /></figure>



<p>For this example, we’re going to add a Customer HTML tag. But if you’re using a service that Google Tag Manager supports, you should use their native integration.</p>



<p>From there, all you have to do is paste your tracking code in the text box. Like this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="488" height="511" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/drip-tracking-code-in-google-tag-manager.png" alt="drip tracking code in google tag manager" class="wp-image-28560" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/drip-tracking-code-in-google-tag-manager.png 488w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/drip-tracking-code-in-google-tag-manager-286x300.png 286w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/drip-tracking-code-in-google-tag-manager-24x24.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/drip-tracking-code-in-google-tag-manager-34x36.png 34w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/drip-tracking-code-in-google-tag-manager-46x48.png 46w" sizes="(max-width: 488px) 100vw, 488px" /></figure>



<p>Now it’s time to add a trigger. If you scroll down from the text block where you just pasted your code, you’ll see a box where you can add a trigger. Click it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="926" height="470" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-add-trigger.png" alt="google tag manager add trigger" class="wp-image-28482" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-add-trigger.png 926w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-add-trigger-300x152.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-add-trigger-768x390.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-add-trigger-24x12.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-add-trigger-36x18.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-add-trigger-48x24.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 926px) 100vw, 926px" /></figure>



<p>In most cases (say, for site-wide tracking codes), you’ll want to click the default “All Pages” trigger.</p>



<p>Once that’s done, it&#8217;s time to hit the &#8220;Save&#8221; button.</p>



<p>You should be back on your dashboard now. In the upper-right hand corner, click the blue “Submit” button.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="217" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-submit-dashboard-1024x217-1.png" alt="google tag manager submit dashboard 1024x217 1" class="wp-image-28501" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-submit-dashboard-1024x217-1.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-submit-dashboard-1024x217-1-300x64.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-submit-dashboard-1024x217-1-768x163.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-submit-dashboard-1024x217-1-24x5.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-submit-dashboard-1024x217-1-36x8.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tag-manager-submit-dashboard-1024x217-1-48x10.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Before you publish, Google Tag Manager wants you to review your changes. Scroll down to make sure everything looks good, then click “Publish” in the upper-right-hand corner.</p>



<p>Congrats! You just added a tag.</p>



<p>Now all you have to do is repeat this step for each of your tracking codes to speed up your Shopify store.</p>

<p>No matter how much optimization you do, it&#8217;s a general rule of thumb that more stuff (sections, code, images etc.) =&#8217;s a slower page speed.</p>



<p>With this in mind, one of the first things we do when we form a new <a href="https://huemor.rocks/grow" rel=" noopener">grow partnership</a> is study their visitors user experience and determine how much of their homepage actually gets viewed.</p>



<p>The result? Typically only 50% of most store&#8217;s homepage is actually viewed. Even less of the pages are interacted with.</p>



<p>That means their typical customer ignores half of their home page.</p>



<p>You already know that people don&#8217;t like slow-loading pages.</p>



<p>Why risk losing customers by making them wait for something they&#8217;re never going to see?</p>



<p>In this tip, we’ll show you how to clear out the dead wood and speed up your Shopify store.</p>



<h3>Step #0: What Makes a Good Homepage?</h3>



<p>An ideal <a href="/blog/ecommerce-homepage-design" rel=" noopener">ecommerce homepage design</a> contains only high-value elements that add to the user experience, so it’s time to take stock of everything, from copy to images, videos to widgets.</p>



<p>When you’re assessing the sections on your homepage, use these criteria to evaluate their value:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Accessible</strong>: Your Shopify store needs intuitive navigation with a clean interface. This is key for good user experience.</li><li><strong>Desirable</strong>: Every image should create a desire to explore or buy; your ideal customer should see themselves (or their desires) in your imagery and design.</li><li><strong>Valuable</strong>: People want content that addresses their questions, pain, and desires.</li><li><strong>Actionable</strong>: Your call to action should be clear, bold, and easy to spot and understand.</li><li><strong>Credible</strong>: Social proof (testimonials and reviews) go a long way towards building your credibility as a brand and as a trustworthy merchant. The best testimonials are from your ideal customer to your ideal customer.</li></ol>



<p>Now it&#8217;s time to grab some data and test your assumptions.</p>



<h3>Step #1: Add Tracking Analytics to Your Homepage</h3>



<p>We recommend <a href="https://www.hotjar.com/r/r358e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Hotjar</a> for learning more about how potential customers interact with your home page.</p>



<p>Once you sign up, you’ll see a dashboard that looks like this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="591" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/get-hotjar-tracking-code-1024x591-1.png" alt="get hotjar tracking code 1024x591 1" class="wp-image-28759" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/get-hotjar-tracking-code-1024x591-1.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/get-hotjar-tracking-code-1024x591-1-300x173.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/get-hotjar-tracking-code-1024x591-1-768x443.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/get-hotjar-tracking-code-1024x591-1-24x14.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/get-hotjar-tracking-code-1024x591-1-36x21.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/get-hotjar-tracking-code-1024x591-1-48x28.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Click the “Tracking” button in the upper-right hand corner to get your tracking code.</p>



<p>Now all you have to do is paste that code into your homepage&#8217;s <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section.</p>



<p>&#8230;If you <a class="fl-scroll-link" href="#gtm">set up Google Tag Manager</a>, then this should be an easy win.</p>



<h3>Step #2: Creating a Heatmap</h3>



<p>Back in Hotjar, click on “Heatmaps” in the left sidebar menu. Then click the green &#8220;New Heatmap&#8221; button.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="620" height="130" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/add-new-heatmap-hotjar.png" alt="add new heatmap hotjar" class="wp-image-28548" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/add-new-heatmap-hotjar.png 620w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/add-new-heatmap-hotjar-300x63.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/add-new-heatmap-hotjar-24x5.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/add-new-heatmap-hotjar-36x8.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/add-new-heatmap-hotjar-48x10.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></figure>



<p>The rest is pretty straightforward.</p>



<ol><li>Give your heatmap a name.</li><li>Select the number of views you want to track (in this case, 2,000 is plenty).</li><li>Enter your homepage’s URL so that Hotjar only records data from that page.</li><li>Click &#8220;Create Heatmap.&#8221; You’re done!</li></ol>



<p>How long you need to wait depends on how much traffic your Shopify store gets.</p>



<h3>Step #3: Interpreting Your Heatmap</h3>



<p>This one’s pretty easy.</p>



<p>First, open your heatmap.</p>



<p>The parts of the heatmap that colored dark red—those are the parts that got the most clicks.</p>

<p>If a section of your homepage looks ignored, that&#8217;s a clear signal that you should remove it.</p>



<div class="ChapterFullwidth" style="background-image:url(https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-form">
<a id="chapter3"></a>
</div><img class="ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Resize.png"/><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">CHAPTER 3</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">Reduce Image Dimensions to Eliminate Browser Scaling</h2></div></div>



<p>Here’s a common mistake: people skip image optimization completely.</p>



<p>You upload images that are so huge your user’s browser has to scale them down when it loads the page.</p>



<p>This is a huge drag on your load time. (Especially for mobile devices.)</p>



<p>In fact, you want smaller images and smaller file sizes.</p>



<p>First, know that Shopify recommends using 2048 x 2048 pixels for product photos. If your images are larger than that, they’re prime candidates for dimension reduction.</p>



<p>The good news is that resizing them is a cinch.</p>



<p>Here’s how to do that:</p>



<h3>Option #1: Use Shopify’s Image Resizer</h3>



<p>Shopify&#8217;s image optimization tool is an amazing option.</p>



<p>First, navigate to <a href="https://www.shopify.com/tools/image-resizer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shopify’s Image Resizer</a> tool.</p>



<p>Upload the photo you want to resize.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="546" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-image-resizer-1024x546-1.png" alt="shopify image resizer 1024x546 1" class="wp-image-28400" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-image-resizer-1024x546-1.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-image-resizer-1024x546-1-300x160.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-image-resizer-1024x546-1-768x410.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-image-resizer-1024x546-1-24x13.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-image-resizer-1024x546-1-36x19.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-image-resizer-1024x546-1-48x26.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Then click &#8220;Submit.&#8221;</p>



<p>If it was successful, you can download the resized image.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="620" height="348" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/download-resized-image-for-shopify.png" alt="download resized image for shopify" class="wp-image-28389" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/download-resized-image-for-shopify.png 620w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/download-resized-image-for-shopify-300x168.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/download-resized-image-for-shopify-24x13.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/download-resized-image-for-shopify-36x20.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/download-resized-image-for-shopify-48x27.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></figure>



<p>Now all you have to do is replace them on your Shopify store.</p>



<h3>Option #2: Photoshop</h3>



<p>Of course, if you’re using Photoshop to edit your product photos, you can also ensure they’re the proper dimensions before sending them off.</p>



<p>First, open your image in Photoshop.</p>



<p>Then to go to File &#8211;&gt; Export &#8211;&gt; Save for Web (Legacy)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="851" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/photoshop-how-to-save-photo-for-web-1024x851-1.png" alt="photoshop how to save photo for web 1024x851 1" class="wp-image-28671" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/photoshop-how-to-save-photo-for-web-1024x851-1.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/photoshop-how-to-save-photo-for-web-1024x851-1-300x249.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/photoshop-how-to-save-photo-for-web-1024x851-1-768x638.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/photoshop-how-to-save-photo-for-web-1024x851-1-24x20.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/photoshop-how-to-save-photo-for-web-1024x851-1-36x30.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/photoshop-how-to-save-photo-for-web-1024x851-1-48x40.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>A new modal will pop up where you can specify dimensions, among other things for image optimization.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="809" height="1024" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/photoshop-save-for-web-dimensions-809x1024-1.png" alt="photoshop save for web dimensions 809x1024 1" class="wp-image-28434" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/photoshop-save-for-web-dimensions-809x1024-1.png 809w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/photoshop-save-for-web-dimensions-809x1024-1-237x300.png 237w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/photoshop-save-for-web-dimensions-809x1024-1-768x972.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/photoshop-save-for-web-dimensions-809x1024-1-19x24.png 19w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/photoshop-save-for-web-dimensions-809x1024-1-28x36.png 28w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/photoshop-save-for-web-dimensions-809x1024-1-38x48.png 38w" sizes="(max-width: 809px) 100vw, 809px" /></figure>



<p>Then click &#8220;Save.&#8221; All done!</p>



<div class="ChapterFullwidth" style="background-image:url(https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-form">
<a id="chapter4"></a>
</div><img class="ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Minify.png"/><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">CHAPTER 4</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">Minify Assets to Improve Page</h2></div></div>



<p>Code can be scary to mess with.</p>



<p>CSS (the code that controls how your Shopify store looks) and JavaScript (the code that controls how your store functions) are essential to running your online store. But the file sizes are can be a burden.</p>



<p>Fortunately, there’s a process called “minification” that can reduce these file sizes by a TON.</p>



<p>(Without modifying the code!)</p>



<p>Minification deletes excess white spaces (including newlines) in the code. Your Shopify store, which is a computer, doesn’t need white space to read code. They&#8217;re only in there for humans.</p>



<p>The quickest way to minify your asset files is to use a paid app like <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/plug-in-speed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plug in Speed</a>. This app offers a 7-day free trial; then it’s $39/month.</p>



<p>If you’d rather save on costs, here’s how to do it yourself.</p>



<h3>Step #1: Download Your CSS and JavaScript Files</h3>



<p>Just to be safe.</p>



<p>In your Shopify Theme folder, you want to look for any files that end in “.css” or “.js.”</p>



<p>Do NOT minify your <i>theme.scss.liquid</i> file. <a href="https://community.shopify.com/c/Shopify-Design/Minifying-a-scss-liquid-file/m-p/358279/highlight/true#M93429" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shopify automatically minifies it</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="432" height="326" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/css-or-scssliquid-minify.png" alt="css or scssliquid minify" class="wp-image-28447" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/css-or-scssliquid-minify.png 432w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/css-or-scssliquid-minify-300x226.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/css-or-scssliquid-minify-24x18.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/css-or-scssliquid-minify-36x27.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/css-or-scssliquid-minify-48x36.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px" /></figure>



<p>Copy each file to a safe space (e.g., your Dropbox or hard drive) just in case something goes awry and you need to revert to the original.</p>



<p>Then it’s time for the next step.</p>



<h3>Step #2: Minify Your Code</h3>



<p>If you’re compressing CSS, use the <a href="https://csscompressor.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CSS Compressor</a>. If you’re compressing JavaScript, then head over to the <a href="https://javascript-minifier.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JavaScript Minifier</a>.</p>



<p>Copy your code into the tool and click &#8220;compress.&#8221;</p>



<p>You’re done! Now all you have to do is replace your unminified code with your newly minified JavaScript and CSS code.</p>



<h3>Step #3: Check Your Page Load Time</h3>



<p>Once you’re done, run another page speed test to check that the file is no longer listed under the “Minify CSS” section.</p>



<p>We recommend GTMetrix to do this analysis.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s <a class="fl-scroll-link" href="#gtmetrix">simple to use</a>—pop your Shopify stores URL into the tool and read the results below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="635" height="138" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2019-05-17-at-16_23_28.png" alt="Screen Shot 2019 05 17 at 16 23 28" class="wp-image-28638" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2019-05-17-at-16_23_28.png 635w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2019-05-17-at-16_23_28-300x65.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2019-05-17-at-16_23_28-24x5.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2019-05-17-at-16_23_28-36x8.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2019-05-17-at-16_23_28-48x10.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px" /></figure>



<p>If you expand any of these benchmarks, they&#8217;ll show you any files you missed.</p>



<p>Sometimes you won&#8217;t be able to access or minify a specific file, and that&#8217;s okay. If you&#8217;re scoring an A, you&#8217;re good to go.</p>

<p>Sometimes it’s the hosting.</p>



<p>Maybe a simple hosting upgrade is all you need to take your Shopify store to the next level.</p>



<p>Moving up to a better Shopify plan can potentially halve your loading time.</p>



<p>(After all, there’s no reason to wait for the inevitable crash that’ll come when thousands of future customers overwhelm your store on Black Friday.)</p>



<p>With a simple upgrade to a better Shopify plan, you can stop worrying about any page speed struggles or devastating downtimes on busy days.</p>



<p>Here’s how:</p>



<h3>Option #1: Upgrading Your Shopify Plan</h3>



<p>Shopify has a few different hosting plans.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="692" height="230" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-price-table.png" alt="shopify price table" class="wp-image-28741" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-price-table.png 692w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-price-table-300x100.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-price-table-24x8.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-price-table-36x12.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-price-table-48x16.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 692px) 100vw, 692px" /></figure>



<p>If you&#8217;re on Basic Shopify or just plain Shopify, you should consider moving to the next tier.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re already on the Advanced Shopify plan, then you need to look into Shopify Plus.</p>



<p>(And if you&#8217;re already on Shopify Plus, then this is not the tip for you.)</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s how to upgrade:</p>



<p>First, navigate to your account settings in your admin portal.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="947" height="563" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-settings-account.png" alt="shopify settings account" class="wp-image-28617" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-settings-account.png 947w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-settings-account-300x178.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-settings-account-768x457.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-settings-account-24x14.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-settings-account-36x21.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-settings-account-48x29.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 947px) 100vw, 947px" /></figure>



<p>From there, click &#8220;Compare Plans.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="950" height="292" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Shopify-account-settings-compare-plans.png" alt="Shopify account settings compare plans" class="wp-image-28718" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Shopify-account-settings-compare-plans.png 950w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Shopify-account-settings-compare-plans-300x92.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Shopify-account-settings-compare-plans-768x236.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Shopify-account-settings-compare-plans-24x7.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Shopify-account-settings-compare-plans-36x11.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Shopify-account-settings-compare-plans-48x15.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px" /></figure>



<p>Now you can see each of the existing plans and upgrade to the one that feels best for you:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="901" height="213" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-upgrade-to-better-plan.png" alt="shopify upgrade to better plan" class="wp-image-28311" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-upgrade-to-better-plan.png 901w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-upgrade-to-better-plan-300x71.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-upgrade-to-better-plan-768x182.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-upgrade-to-better-plan-24x6.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-upgrade-to-better-plan-36x9.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-upgrade-to-better-plan-48x11.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 901px) 100vw, 901px" /></figure>



<p>Then click &#8220;Choose this plan&#8221; and follow the steps to finish upgrading.</p>



<h3>Option #2: Upgrade to Shopify Plus</h3>



<p>Shopify Plus is a huge asset&#8230;but it also comes with a $2,000/month price tag.</p>



<p>Our friends at The Shop Pad created <a href="https://blog.theshoppad.com/buyers-guide-to-shopify-plus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a detailed buyer&#8217;s guide to Shopify Plus</a> that you should read if you&#8217;re seriously considering upgrading.</p>



<p>But if you just want the skinny, keep reading.</p>



<h4>Step #1: Talk to Shopify</h4>



<p>One does not simply upgrade to Shopify plus.</p>



<p>That’s because Shopify Plus is only for a specific set of users. If that’s not you, then you have to wait until it is.</p>



<p>To get started, head over the <a href="https://www.shopify.com/plus/upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shopify’s upgrade page</a>.</p>



<p>You’ll see all the benefits of switching to Shopify Plus:</p>



<ol><li>Unlimited accounts</li><li>API access</li><li>Access to Shopify Plus Partners</li><li>Unlimited Bandwidth</li><li>Tax automation</li><li>Dev environments</li><li>Wholesale order management</li><li>Scheduled campaigns</li></ol>



<p>&#8230;and etc. It unlocks Shopify&#8217;s full power.</p>



<p>If your business is ready, talk to one of their experts.</p>



<p>At this point, faster load times are just a perk.</p>

<p>The truth is there’s no <em>need</em> to do anything after you upgrade to Shopify plus.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/page-weight" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTTP Archive</a>, the median page size for mobile web pages in April 2019 was 1682.4 KB, or up 76% from the 955.8 KB it was in April 2017.</p>



<p>This is directly related to the growth of video content.</p>



<p>And although <a href="https://speedcurve.com/blog/web-performance-page-bloat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">page size isn&#8217;t the best metric to track</a>, it&#8217;s still worth talking about (and thinking about).</p>



<p>Thankfully, you can free up your server and keep your Shopify store running at top page speed by using an external platform like YouTube or Vimeo to host videos.</p>



<p>Here’s how to feature videos the right way.</p>



<h3>Step #1: Check for Uploaded Videos</h3>



<p>It’s entirely possible none of the videos you use are actually on your Shopify store.</p>



<p>To check, go to Settings → Files.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="939" height="529" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/files-shopify-settings.png" alt="files shopify settings" class="wp-image-28734" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/files-shopify-settings.png 939w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/files-shopify-settings-300x169.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/files-shopify-settings-768x433.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/files-shopify-settings-24x14.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/files-shopify-settings-36x20.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/files-shopify-settings-48x27.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 939px) 100vw, 939px" /></figure>



<p>Now search for the most common video extensions (&#8220;.avi,&#8221; &#8220;.flv,&#8221; &#8220;.mp4,&#8221; &#8220;.mov,&#8221; and &#8220;.wav&#8221;) to bring up all videos that could be uploaded to your Shopify store.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="944" height="382" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-search-videos.png" alt="shopify search videos" class="wp-image-28526" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-search-videos.png 944w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-search-videos-300x121.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-search-videos-768x311.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-search-videos-24x10.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-search-videos-36x15.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-search-videos-48x19.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 944px) 100vw, 944px" /></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, you have to download a video file before you can store it somewhere else.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s what you&#8217;ll do in step #2.</p>



<h3>Step #2: Download your videos</h3>



<p>If you have any videos uploaded to your Shopify store, downloading them is pretty easy.</p>



<p>First, click the video’s name right on the Files page. That’ll take you to where the video lives on the Shopify CDN.</p>



<p>Now you can download the video.</p>



<p>Click the 3 dots in the bottom right corner of the video.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="328" height="226" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/click-the-dots-shopify-video.png" alt="click the dots shopify video" class="wp-image-28604" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/click-the-dots-shopify-video.png 328w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/click-the-dots-shopify-video-300x207.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/click-the-dots-shopify-video-24x17.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/click-the-dots-shopify-video-36x25.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/click-the-dots-shopify-video-48x33.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 328px) 100vw, 328px" /></figure>



<p>Then press &#8220;Download.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="281" height="165" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/download-video-from-shopify-cdn.png" alt="download video from shopify cdn" class="wp-image-28438" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/download-video-from-shopify-cdn.png 281w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/download-video-from-shopify-cdn-24x14.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/download-video-from-shopify-cdn-36x21.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/download-video-from-shopify-cdn-48x28.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px" /></figure>



<p>Super easy. Now it’s time to upload them on a dedicated video server.</p>



<h3>Step #3: Upload Your Videos</h3>



<p>Any of the premier video-hosting services—<a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a>, and <a href="https://wistia.com/">Wistia</a>—work perfectly with Shopify. The platform you choose is up to preference.</p>



<p>(We&#8217;re going to use Vimeo.)</p>



<p>After creating an account, upload your video.</p>



<p>On Vimeo, click the blue &#8220;Upload&#8221; button either in the navigation or right below the logo on the home page.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="347" height="149" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vimeo-upload-a-video.png" alt="vimeo upload a video" class="wp-image-28525" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vimeo-upload-a-video.png 347w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vimeo-upload-a-video-300x129.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vimeo-upload-a-video-24x10.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vimeo-upload-a-video-36x15.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vimeo-upload-a-video-48x21.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 347px) 100vw, 347px" /></figure>



<p>Then follow the on-screen directions to upload your video.</p>



<p>Once that’s done, navigate to your video and click the &#8220;Share&#8221; button.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="795" height="494" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vimeo-share-button-locations.png" alt="vimeo share button locations" class="wp-image-28460" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vimeo-share-button-locations.png 795w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vimeo-share-button-locations-300x186.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vimeo-share-button-locations-768x477.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vimeo-share-button-locations-24x15.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vimeo-share-button-locations-36x22.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vimeo-share-button-locations-48x30.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px" /></figure>



<p>Click on the Share button and grab the embed code.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="550" height="400" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vimeo-copy-embed-code.png" alt="vimeo copy embed code" class="wp-image-28457" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vimeo-copy-embed-code.png 550w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vimeo-copy-embed-code-300x218.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vimeo-copy-embed-code-24x17.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vimeo-copy-embed-code-36x26.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vimeo-copy-embed-code-48x35.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></figure>



<p>Now you’re ready to embed the video on your Shopify store.</p>



<h3>Step #4: Embed the Video on Your Shopify Store</h3>



<p>Here&#8217;s how to embed a video in Shopify.</p>



<p>Navigate to the blog post or page where you want your video to be.</p>



<p>Click on the code editor button to switch to the HTML editor.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="584" height="385" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/video-post-or-page-html-shopify.png" alt="video post or page html shopify" class="wp-image-28493" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/video-post-or-page-html-shopify.png 584w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/video-post-or-page-html-shopify-300x198.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/video-post-or-page-html-shopify-24x16.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/video-post-or-page-html-shopify-36x24.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/video-post-or-page-html-shopify-48x32.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" /></figure>



<p>Then paste the embed code you grabbed from Vimeo.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="595" height="368" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/paste-video-embed-code-shopify.png" alt="paste video embed code shopify" class="wp-image-28444" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/paste-video-embed-code-shopify.png 595w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/paste-video-embed-code-shopify-300x186.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/paste-video-embed-code-shopify-24x15.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/paste-video-embed-code-shopify-36x22.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/paste-video-embed-code-shopify-48x30.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px" /></figure>



<p>Finally, switch out of the HTML editor to ensure everything looks good.</p>



<p>If it does, time to hit publish!</p>



<h3>Bonus: Lazy Load Your Video</h3>



<p>If you’re really serious about optimizing your load times, then moving your videos from Shopify to a dedicated video hosting platform isn’t enough.</p>



<p>You should also lazy load your videos so that they don’t load before they’re visible on your customer&#8217;s screen.</p>



<p>To do that, check out <a class="fl-scroll-link" href="#lazy-load">the lazy loading section</a> of this post.</p>



<div class="ChapterFullwidth" style="background-image:url(https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-form">
<a id="chapter7"></a>
</div><img class="ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Mobile.png"/><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">Chapter 7</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">Reach Customers on the Go with a Fast, Mobile-Responsive Shopify Theme</h2></div></div>



<p>It’s crucial to connect with mobile users.</p>



<p>And a responsive Shopify theme can make all the difference.</p>



<p>You should test your theme for potential issues across devices and screen sizes.</p>



<p>This is easy to do with Google Chrome.</p>



<h3>Step #1: Get Set Up</h3>



<p>If your mobile performance isn’t good, it doesn’t matter how fast it loads. Nobody will buy from you.</p>



<p>&#8230;after all, a Google study found that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8rCOOBh6tk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=941" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">79%</a> of smartphone users used their mobile device to make an online purchase in the last six months.</p>



<p>(That was in 2010.)</p>



<p>The number today is probably MUCH higher.</p>



<p>And if your Shopify store looks like it was hacked together by an amateur, it&#8217;ll hurt your credibility.</p>



<p>Let’s double-check your store across a few different devices.</p>



<p>First, go to the developer tools from the View → Developer → Developer Tools menu.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="623" height="361" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-view-developer-tools.png" alt="how to view developer tools" class="wp-image-28648" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-view-developer-tools.png 623w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-view-developer-tools-300x174.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-view-developer-tools-24x14.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-view-developer-tools-36x21.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-view-developer-tools-48x28.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px" /><figcaption>how to view developer tools</figcaption></figure>



<p>You’ll see something that looks like this as a popup or on the right side of your screen:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="602" height="300" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/developer-tools-toggle-mobile.png" alt="developer tools toggle mobile" class="wp-image-28516" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/developer-tools-toggle-mobile.png 602w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/developer-tools-toggle-mobile-300x150.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/developer-tools-toggle-mobile-24x12.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/developer-tools-toggle-mobile-36x18.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/developer-tools-toggle-mobile-48x24.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></figure>



<p>Click on the icon with the cell phone and the tablet on the menu. That lets you toggle between desktop and mobile views.</p>



<p>See where it says iPhone X? You can open that drop-down menu and select the device you want to test from.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="365" height="29" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/developer-tools-toggle-between-devices.png" alt="developer tools toggle between devices" class="wp-image-28786" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/developer-tools-toggle-between-devices.png 365w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/developer-tools-toggle-between-devices-300x24.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/developer-tools-toggle-between-devices-24x2.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/developer-tools-toggle-between-devices-36x3.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/developer-tools-toggle-between-devices-48x4.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 365px) 100vw, 365px" /></figure>



<p>Now you can test for different devices.</p>



<h3>Step #2: Check for Mobile Responsiveness</h3>



<p>Ask yourself the following questions as you evaluate your Shopify theme:</p>



<ol><li>Do all images look good on mobile?</li><li>Does the navigation look clear on mobile devices?</li><li>Are the buttons big enough and user-friendly? (Think about people with big fingers!)</li><li>Is it easy to scroll up and down? Does it scroll at a reasonable pace?</li><li>How is the <a href="/blog/checkout-page-design" rel=" noopener">checkout page</a> experience?</li><li>Is it a seamless customer journey with minimal touchpoints?</li><li>Is it easy to check out on a mobile phone?</li></ol>



<p>If any of those are a “no,” it’s either time to hire a developer to fix them or find an entirely new Shopify theme.</p>



<h3>Step #3: Test and optimize Your Shopify Sites Page Speed</h3>



<p><a href="https://tools.pingdom.com/">Pingdom</a> is the best tool for an at-a-glance benchmark of your Shopify store’s page speed. It’s very easy to use, too.</p>



<p>First, pop your store’s preferred URL into the tool.</p>



<p>Then select the location you want to test from.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="239" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-use-pingdom-1024x239-1.png" alt="how to use pingdom 1024x239 1" class="wp-image-28729" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-use-pingdom-1024x239-1.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-use-pingdom-1024x239-1-300x70.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-use-pingdom-1024x239-1-768x179.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-use-pingdom-1024x239-1-24x6.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-use-pingdom-1024x239-1-36x8.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-use-pingdom-1024x239-1-48x11.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Now click &#8220;Start Test.&#8221;</p>



<p>Then you’ll see a list of optimizations Pingdom wants you to make:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="348" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pingdom-optimizations-1024x348-1.png" alt="pingdom optimizations 1024x348 1" class="wp-image-28328" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pingdom-optimizations-1024x348-1.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pingdom-optimizations-1024x348-1-300x102.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pingdom-optimizations-1024x348-1-768x261.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pingdom-optimizations-1024x348-1-24x8.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pingdom-optimizations-1024x348-1-36x12.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pingdom-optimizations-1024x348-1-48x16.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>You can even see which files take the longest to load, so you can hand that off to a developer and ask them to reduce those wait times.</p>

<p>Ever go to a government building and learn that you’re in the wrong place and need to go somewhere else?</p>



<p>(Rhetorical question, we know.)</p>



<p>That&#8217;s kind of like a redirect on your Shopify store.</p>



<p>And it makes your store take <em>much</em> longer to load.</p>



<p>To make your store as fast as possible, you need to throw the DMV workflow out the window.</p>



<p>Here’s how:</p>



<h3>Step #1: Identify Your Redirects</h3>



<p>First, open up your Shopify store’s backend and navigate to your URL Redirects portal.</p>



<p>Like this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="537" height="526" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/navigate-to-redirects-in-shopify.png" alt="navigate to redirects in shopify" class="wp-image-28489" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/navigate-to-redirects-in-shopify.png 537w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/navigate-to-redirects-in-shopify-300x294.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/navigate-to-redirects-in-shopify-24x24.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/navigate-to-redirects-in-shopify-36x36.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/navigate-to-redirects-in-shopify-48x48.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 537px) 100vw, 537px" /></figure>



<p>This displays most of your store’s active redirects.</p>



<p>You can even filter for specific pages, like this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="935" height="342" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/search-for-redirects-in-shopify.png" alt="search for redirects in shopify" class="wp-image-28459" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/search-for-redirects-in-shopify.png 935w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/search-for-redirects-in-shopify-300x110.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/search-for-redirects-in-shopify-768x281.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/search-for-redirects-in-shopify-24x9.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/search-for-redirects-in-shopify-36x13.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/search-for-redirects-in-shopify-48x18.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 935px) 100vw, 935px" /></figure>



<p>Pretty neat, right?</p>



<p>Now it’s time for the next step.</p>



<h3>Step #2: Fix 404s and Errors</h3>



<p>A 404 error means a page couldn’t be found.</p>



<p>While it’s a good strategy to create a 404 page…</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="563" height="417" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/huemor-404-page.png" alt="huemor 404 page" class="wp-image-28721" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/huemor-404-page.png 563w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/huemor-404-page-300x222.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/huemor-404-page-24x18.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/huemor-404-page-36x27.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/huemor-404-page-48x36.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 563px) 100vw, 563px" /></figure>



<p>(like this)</p>



<p>&#8230;it’s also a good idea to add redirects away from anything that points to a 404.</p>



<p>How can you find these elusive pages?</p>



<p>Use the <a href="https://www.brokenlinkcheck.com/">Broken Link Checker</a>. It’s easy.</p>



<p>Enter your Shopify store’s URL and let it run.</p>



<p>If the tool finds any broken links, you’ll get a list.</p>



<p>The best part?</p>



<p>You can click on the little “src” link and it’ll show you exactly where the link is in the page’s code.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="664" height="468" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/broken-link-checker-find-HTML-src-location-of-broken-links.png" alt="broken link checker find HTML src location of broken links" class="wp-image-28686" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/broken-link-checker-find-HTML-src-location-of-broken-links.png 664w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/broken-link-checker-find-HTML-src-location-of-broken-links-300x211.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/broken-link-checker-find-HTML-src-location-of-broken-links-24x17.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/broken-link-checker-find-HTML-src-location-of-broken-links-36x25.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/broken-link-checker-find-HTML-src-location-of-broken-links-48x34.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 664px) 100vw, 664px" /></figure>



<p>Now that you know where your broken links are, you can correct the URLs in Shopify.</p>



<h3>Step #3: Find Redirect Chains</h3>



<p>Sometimes you have to move a page or resource, so you create a redirect to keep people from landing on a 404.</p>



<p>But then you move it <em>again</em>.</p>



<p>Like that time in your 20’s when you lived in 7 different places in a single summer and the postal service had to keep forwarding your mail.</p>



<p>Someone tried to reach you in Boston but you forwarded your mail to Denver&#8230;but by that point, you were living in Pittsburgh. And so on.</p>



<p>This is called a redirect chain. (They’re awful.)</p>



<p>It looks like this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="483" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/redirect-1024x483-1.png" alt="redirect 1024x483 1" class="wp-image-28323" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/redirect-1024x483-1.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/redirect-1024x483-1-300x142.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/redirect-1024x483-1-768x362.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/redirect-1024x483-1-24x11.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/redirect-1024x483-1-36x17.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/redirect-1024x483-1-48x23.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Instead of flying your rocket all the way from Hala to Xandar and being told you need to head to Terra, just skip the pit stop and go directly to Terra. Much faster, right?</p>



<p>If you already subscribe to an SEO tool like <a href="https://ahrefs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ahrefs</a> or <a href="https://moz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moz</a>, you can go ahead and use them for this process.</p>



<p>If not, <a href="https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">download the ScreamingFrog website crawler.</a></p>



<p>You can only crawl 500 URLs with the free version, but that should be enough (unless you have a large Shopify store).</p>



<p>Here’s how to run the crawl:</p>



<p>In ScreamingFrog, at the very top, enter your store’s URL.</p>



<p>Then click &#8220;Start.&#8221;</p>



<p>Easy so far, right?</p>



<p>Once that’s done, get the redirect report from the menu by going to Reports → Redirect &amp; Canonical Chains.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="796" height="68" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/screaming-frog-find-redirect-and-canonical-chains.png" alt="screaming frog find redirect and canonical chains" class="wp-image-28580" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/screaming-frog-find-redirect-and-canonical-chains.png 796w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/screaming-frog-find-redirect-and-canonical-chains-300x26.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/screaming-frog-find-redirect-and-canonical-chains-768x66.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/screaming-frog-find-redirect-and-canonical-chains-24x2.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/screaming-frog-find-redirect-and-canonical-chains-36x3.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/screaming-frog-find-redirect-and-canonical-chains-48x4.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 796px) 100vw, 796px" /></figure>



<p>That should export a .csv file. Open it in your favorite spreadsheet app.</p>



<p>This displays your Shopify stores redirects.</p>



<p>To check for redirect chains, find the column that says “Redirect URL 2.”</p>



<p>If there’s anything there&#8230;you have a redirect chain. Eww.</p>



<p>(If it’s empty, congratulations! You don’t have any redirect chains.)</p>



<p>Fortunately, ScreamingFrog makes it easy to fix those.</p>



<p>Your report has 2 columns that tell you exactly how to optimize your redirects—&#8221;Address&#8221; and “Final Address.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="200" height="71" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/screaming-frog-redirect-report-address-final-address.png" alt="screaming frog redirect report address final address" class="wp-image-28441" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/screaming-frog-redirect-report-address-final-address.png 200w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/screaming-frog-redirect-report-address-final-address-24x9.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/screaming-frog-redirect-report-address-final-address-36x13.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/screaming-frog-redirect-report-address-final-address-48x17.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></figure>



<p>Now you can search each item in the “Address” column and make sure it points directly to the destination in “Final Address.”</p>



<p>Bye-bye to the DMV workflow. Hello to happy customers.</p>



<div class="ChapterFullwidth" style="background-image:url(https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-form">

<p>Your Shopify store must be ready for users on mobile devices because they won’t hang around for a store that moves at a snail’s pace.</p>



<p>Lucky for you, it’s easy to create Accelerated Mobile Pages that load in the blink of an eye.</p>



<p>You just need a killer AMP App.</p>



<p>In fact, the team at <a href="https://lp.chartbeat.com/thenewspeedofmobileengagement_download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chartbeat</a> found that people read AMP content for longer than they read standard web content.</p>



<p>And the longer someone engages with your Shopify store, <a href="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/e94159ca61266ff226e8664c5/files/Gilbride_purchase_behavior_jm.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the more likely they are to buy</a>&#8230;and they&#8217;ll buy more, too.</p>



<p>Shopify has a few you can install:</p>



<ol><li><a href="https://apps.shopify.com/ampify-me" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AMP by AMPify Me</a></li><li><a href="https://apps.shopify.com/amp-google" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AMP by Shop Sheriff</a></li><li><a href="https://apps.shopify.com/amp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FireAMP by MLveda</a></li></ol>



<p>(We assume you chose AMP by Shop Sheriff.)</p>



<p>Once you’ve installed your app, scroll down in the Dashboard and publish your AMP pages.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="732" height="1024" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopsheriff-amp-dashboard-732x1024-1.png" alt="shopsheriff amp dashboard 732x1024 1" class="wp-image-28514" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopsheriff-amp-dashboard-732x1024-1.png 732w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopsheriff-amp-dashboard-732x1024-1-214x300.png 214w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopsheriff-amp-dashboard-732x1024-1-17x24.png 17w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopsheriff-amp-dashboard-732x1024-1-26x36.png 26w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopsheriff-amp-dashboard-732x1024-1-34x48.png 34w" sizes="(max-width: 732px) 100vw, 732px" /></figure>



<p>The app does most of the heavy lifting for you, which is nice.</p>



<p>&#8230;But you can also customize how your pages look for that extra level of control.</p>



<p>Once you’re done, all you have to do is wait about a week for Google to crawl your new AMP pages.</p>



<div class="ChapterFullwidth" style="background-image:url(https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-form">

<p>Apps are great. But more apps means more code.</p>



<p>More code means a slower Shopify store.</p>



<p>A slower store means less revenue.</p>



<p>Eww.</p>



<p>In this tip, you’ll learn how to ditch the dead weight apps that are costing you dollars.</p>



<h3>Step #1: Find Your Currently Installed Apps</h3>



<p>Head over to your apps.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="227" height="268" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-navigate-to-apps.png" alt="shopify navigate to apps" class="wp-image-28517" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-navigate-to-apps.png 227w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-navigate-to-apps-20x24.png 20w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-navigate-to-apps-30x36.png 30w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-navigate-to-apps-41x48.png 41w" sizes="(max-width: 227px) 100vw, 227px" /></figure>



<p>Shopify displays your currently installed apps.</p>



<h3>Step #2: Audit Your Apps</h3>



<p>For each app in your Shopify store, ask:</p>



<ol><li>How often do you use this app?</li><li>Does this app help you hit your goals?</li><li>How would your store suffer if you removed it, if at all?</li></ol>



<p>If an app isn&#8217;t essential, it&#8217;s time to shortlist it for deletion.</p>



<p>(&#8230;just make sure that it’s actually not essential.)</p>



<h3>Step #3: Delete Your Apps</h3>



<p>Deleting apps from your Shopify store should be safe.</p>



<p>But you want to protect yourself in case you make a mistake.</p>



<p>For that reason, we recommend you check in with a developer before you start deleting apps.</p>



<p>Sometimes an app that you don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re using is actually integral to your Shopify store!</p>



<div class="ChapterFullwidth" style="background-image:url(https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-form">
<a id="chapter11"></a>
</div><img class="ChapterFullwitdh-icons_chapter" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Quickview.png"/><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">Chapter 11</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">Analyze Quick View Pop-Ups to Understand User Interest</h2></div></div>



<p>Quick view pop-ups are great. Just a little rollover + click and the product info appears.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="301" height="419" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/quick-view-mouseover-1.png" alt="quick view mouseover 1" class="wp-image-28509" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/quick-view-mouseover-1.png 301w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/quick-view-mouseover-1-216x300.png 216w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/quick-view-mouseover-1-17x24.png 17w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/quick-view-mouseover-1-26x36.png 26w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/quick-view-mouseover-1-34x48.png 34w" sizes="(max-width: 301px) 100vw, 301px" /></figure>



<p>But they add a ton of data&#8230;which is a drag on your load time.</p>



<p>Are they worth it? Are your customers even using them?</p>



<p>Better get some data to see which pop-ups are worth keeping.</p>



<h3>Step #1: Identify the Pop-Ups to Examine</h3>



<p>While it might be tempting to analyze all the pop-ups, you should pick the 30-35 most important product pages to test.</p>



<p>Which products do you sell the most of?</p>



<p>Which products do you think you should be selling more of?</p>



<p>Those are the product pages you want to examine.</p>



<h3>Step #2: Collect Your Data</h3>



<p>Did you set up <a class="fl-scroll-link" href="#dead-weight">Hotjar</a>?</p>



<p>If you did, then make sure you create a heatmap for each <a href="/blog/product-page-design" rel=" noopener">product page design</a> or <a href="/blog/category-page-design" rel=" noopener">product category page design</a> you want to test.</p>



<p>Then all you have to do is hang back and wait for the data to collect.</p>



<p>If you didn’t (or if you don’t like Hotjar), then <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/hindsight-visitor-recording-and-heatmapping" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hindsight</a> and <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/lucky-orange" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lucky Orange</a> work as substitutes.</p>



<p>(Apps like Lucky Orange will slow down your Shopify store during this analysis. Remove them when you’re done!)</p>



<h3>Step #3: Test, Test, and Test</h3>



<p>Now that you have your data, turn off the pop-ups and wait for the data to collect again.</p>



<p>Make sure you collect your sales data separately from the previous test.</p>



<p>(This is called an <em>A/B test</em> or <em>split test</em>, by the way.)</p>



<h3>Step #4: Analyze Your Data</h3>



<p>Now you have your data. (Hooray!) But you have to analyze it.</p>



<p>Sometimes, the results are clear. You remove the popups and sales increase.</p>



<p>Other times, you see no effect. (Or a negligible effect.)</p>



<p>If you’re handy with stats, <a href="https://blog.sheetgo.com/google-sheets-formulas/correlation-formula-google-sheets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we recommend using a simple correlation</a> to determine the effect of removing popups on your sales.</p>



<h3>Step #5: Take Action</h3>



<p>If the analysis shows an uptick in sales when popups are gone, then it’s pretty clear where you need to do.</p>



<p>If there’s no difference, what you need to do is still clear—get rid of them. They’re not contributing.</p>



<p>The only time you shouldn’t remove these popups is when you would see a clear decrease in sales.</p>

<p>Big Shopify stores sometimes use <a href="https://ablesense.com/blogs/news/nested-collections-in-shopify" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">collections</a> to create a hierarchy of items.</p>



<p>And while that can be great for UX, nested collections with large numbers of items are sluggish to load.</p>



<p>Why?</p>



<p>It&#8217;s because of the code. Bear with us.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s this code structure in your Shopify store called a <em>for loop.</em> It works like this:</p>



<p><code>For every item in your collection, starting at the first and going to the last:<br> Step #1: Check some condition.<br> Step #2: If that condition was false, do nothing. If that condition was true, do some action.<br> Step #3: Move to the next item.<br> Step #4: Return to Step #1.<br> </code></p>



<p>That “do some action” in Step #2 is sometimes another <em>for loop</em>.</p>



<p>In other words, one<em> for loop</em> is sometimes nested inside another <em>for loop</em>, kind of like those <em>Matryoshka</em> Russian nesting dolls. (Or a gag gift.)</p>



<p>In this case, your Shopify store runs the inner loop for each item in the outer loop.</p>



<p>So if you have 50 collections with 2,000 products each, that’s 100,000 (50 x 2,000) operations.</p>



<p>Your store is fast&#8230;but it&#8217;s not that fast.</p>



<p><strong>The solution?</strong></p>



<p>(One that doesn&#8217;t require hiring a developer to refactor your store&#8217;s code?)</p>



<p>It’s <a href="https://www.findify.io/smart-collections.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Findify</a>.</p>



<p>Findify is easy to integrate, is capable of processing large collections in seconds, and even supports multiple languages.</p>



<p>Instead of making your loop smarter, Findify uses an entirely different solution: smart searching.</p>



<p>Now you don&#8217;t have to loop through your collections and products to show what your customer wants: Findify does it faster.</p>



<p>But that&#8217;s not all. Findify doubles as a personal shopper&#8212;it analyzes your customers&#8217; behavior and learns to recommend the products they&#8217;re most likely to purchase.</p>



<p>The result? Your customers see more products that they like, so they buy more.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s how they get amazing results for their customers, like helping <a href="https://www.findify.io/uploads/4/4/0/0/44002511/findify-customer-case-petngo.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mexican pet supplies company Pet n&#8217;Go up their conversions by 35%</a>.</p>

<p>If big collections are your pain point, they&#8217;re worth reaching out to. You&#8217;ll get a faster Shopify store <em>and</em> smarter filtering in one package.</p>

<p>Slow-loading images are torturous.</p>



<p>Why make people wait for a page to load because something at the bottom of the screen got jammed in traffic?</p>



<p>Lazy loading optimizes your Shopify store because it forces your store to only load the immediately visible parts of the page.</p>



<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/offscreen-images" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lazy loading</a> works by displaying low-quality placeholder images first.</p>



<p>Then, as you scroll down the page, the high-quality image replaces the placeholder once it comes into the view.</p>



<p>Way more efficient, right?</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes/blob/gh-pages/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lazysizes</a> by aFarkas is a fast and SEO-friendly lazy loading JavaScript library for images, videos, and iframe assets. It can also help you implement responsive images (images that adapt to different screens sizes), which is a huge bonus.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it takes a bit of effort and a lot of time to set up, especially for a larger store with many images.</p>



<p>Here’s how to get started with Lazysizes.</p>



<h3>Step #1: Navigate to Your Assets Folder</h3>



<p>Log into your Shopify store’s backend. Then go to Online Store → Themes → Edit Code → Assets.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="475" height="539" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-navigate-to-assets-folder.png" alt="shopify navigate to assets folder" class="wp-image-28567" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-navigate-to-assets-folder.png 475w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-navigate-to-assets-folder-264x300.png 264w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-navigate-to-assets-folder-21x24.png 21w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-navigate-to-assets-folder-32x36.png 32w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-navigate-to-assets-folder-42x48.png 42w" sizes="(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px" /></figure>



<p>Super easy. You’ve done this before.</p>



<h3>Step #2: Create a Lazysizes.min.js File</h3>



<p>Click on “Add New Asset.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="278" height="185" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/add-new-asset.png" alt="add new asset" class="wp-image-28377" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/add-new-asset.png 278w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/add-new-asset-24x16.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/add-new-asset-36x24.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/add-new-asset-48x32.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 278px) 100vw, 278px" /></figure>



<p>This will launch a modal with two tabs. Click the “Create a blank file” tab and fill out “lazysizes.min.” Then select the “.js” extension, like this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="619" height="252" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/add-lazysizes-min-js-asset-file.png" alt="add lazysizes min js asset file" class="wp-image-28442" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/add-lazysizes-min-js-asset-file.png 619w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/add-lazysizes-min-js-asset-file-300x122.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/add-lazysizes-min-js-asset-file-24x10.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/add-lazysizes-min-js-asset-file-36x15.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/add-lazysizes-min-js-asset-file-48x20.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 619px) 100vw, 619px" /></figure>



<p>Click “Add asset.”</p>



<h3>Step #3: Add the Lazysizes Code</h3>



<p>Navigate to <a href="http://afarkas.github.io/lazysizes/lazysizes.min.js">the content of the lazysizes.min.js</a> file on Github.</p>



<p>Then copy and paste it into the new asset file you just created on your Shopify store.</p>



<p>Click &#8220;Save.&#8221;</p>



<h3>Step #4: Call the Lazysizes.min.js File from Your Shopify Theme</h3>



<p>Head to Themes → theme.liquid.</p>



<p>At the bottom of the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section (right before you see <code>&lt;/head&gt;</code>), paste the following line of code:</p>



<p><code>&lt;script src="{{ 'lazysizes.min.js' | asset_url }}" async=""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></p>



<p>This means your store will execute the code in the Lazysizes library right before it loads.</p>



<p>Now we’re all set up.</p>



<h3>Step #5: Add the Lazysizes Class to the Images You Want to Lazy Load</h3>



<p>This is the most time-consuming step.</p>



<p>You need to add the <code>class="lazyload"</code> snippet to every &lt;<code>img&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> tag on your Shopify store that you want to lazy load.</p>



<p>First, go to the page or post you want to edit.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="926" height="288" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/navigate-to-post-or-page-to-edit-shopify.png" alt="navigate to post or page to edit shopify" class="wp-image-28720" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/navigate-to-post-or-page-to-edit-shopify.png 926w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/navigate-to-post-or-page-to-edit-shopify-300x93.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/navigate-to-post-or-page-to-edit-shopify-768x239.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/navigate-to-post-or-page-to-edit-shopify-24x7.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/navigate-to-post-or-page-to-edit-shopify-36x11.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/navigate-to-post-or-page-to-edit-shopify-48x15.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 926px) 100vw, 926px" /></figure>



<p>Then go to the HTML editor in the post.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="624" height="318" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-html-editor.png" alt="shopify html editor" class="wp-image-28541" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-html-editor.png 624w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-html-editor-300x153.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-html-editor-24x12.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-html-editor-36x18.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-html-editor-48x24.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></figure>



<p>From there, do a Control + F (or Command + F) for all <code>&lt;img</code> tags. Then add the <code>class="lazyload"</code> and replace the <code>src</code> tag with the <code>data-src</code> tag, like this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/6606556/Imported_Blog_Media/lazy-load-shopify-video-300x39.png" alt="Image showing the slightly different source code for lazy loading an image with the lazysizes library in the Shopify page editor" class="wp-image-22567"/></figure>



<p>Remember to save your changes!</p>

<p>Carousels—those automated marquee slideshows that display different images—look great&#8230;but they’re slow.</p>



<p>Here’s some tough love:</p>



<p>Your customers don’t care about carousels.</p>



<p>They look bad on mobile devices, add distracting movement to the page, and <a href="https://erikrunyon.com/2013/07/carousel-interaction-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">don’t inspire people to take action</a>.</p>



<p>It’s time to throw the carousel in the compactor and get with the times. Use a Hero Layout.</p>



<p>Here’s how:</p>



<h3>Step #0: What’s a Hero Layout?</h3>



<p>A Hero Layout, or Hero Image, is a large image with catchy text.</p>



<p>It’s usually at the top of the homepage because it’s meant to capture attention and deliver a gut-punching impact to the potential customers that arrive to your Shopify store.</p>



<p>A winning Hero Layout has three key components:</p>



<ol><li><strong>High-Quality Image</strong>: Use a captivating, high-resolution visual that catches the eye. Remember: you can resize your image down, but never resize up. High-resolution images rarely look fuzzy.</li><li><strong>Clear Message</strong>: A great hero image must represent your brand mission to users as soon as they arrive. What are you offering? Why should users care about you?</li><li><strong>Call to Action</strong>: Inspire some action with a strong CTA that encourages users to browse your products or check out a special deal.</li></ol>



<p>Your hero layout is your you-get-it-or-you-don’t power play. It’s your nonverbal signal to your #1 buyer persona: this is what we’re about and we’re perfect for people like you.</p>



<p>Here’s an example of a Hero Layout we created for our client, <a href="https://tohaveandtoborrow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">To Have or to Borrow</a>:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="498" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/to-have-or-to-borrow-hero-layout-1024x498-1.png" alt="to have or to borrow hero layout 1024x498 1" class="wp-image-28361" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/to-have-or-to-borrow-hero-layout-1024x498-1.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/to-have-or-to-borrow-hero-layout-1024x498-1-300x146.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/to-have-or-to-borrow-hero-layout-1024x498-1-768x374.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/to-have-or-to-borrow-hero-layout-1024x498-1-24x12.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/to-have-or-to-borrow-hero-layout-1024x498-1-36x18.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/to-have-or-to-borrow-hero-layout-1024x498-1-48x23.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Pretty effective, right?</p>



<p>Here’s how to make one:</p>



<h3>Step #1: Identify Your Buyer Persona</h3>



<p>You probably have one of these already, but just in case you don’t—a buyer persona is a demographic/psychological profile of your ideal customer.</p>



<p>The reason you identify the buyer persona you want to target is because it lets you get specific with your messaging.</p>



<p>Once you know what your ideal buyer is looking for, it’s time to move on to the next step.</p>



<h3>Step #2: Deconstruct Your Carousel</h3>



<p>Which image in your carousel appeals the most to your ideal buyer persona?</p>



<p>That’s the image you want to use for your hero layout.</p>



<p>If you aren’t sure, talk to your customers and ask them.</p>



<p>Or you can put up a different section each week, record the click data, and then make your decision.</p>



<p>Either way, you should leave this step with a single winning layout idea.</p>



<h3>Step #3: Create Your Hero Layout</h3>



<p>If your slider already looks like a Hero layout, then most of the work is done for you.</p>



<p>But otherwise, here’s how to make one:</p>



<h4>Hero Layout Step #1: Select/Create an Image that Features Both Your Product and Ideal Customer</h4>



<p>You probably have some product photos that already fit the bill.</p>



<p>But in case you don’t, you’ll have to collaborate with your product designer or photographer to take some.</p>



<p>Don’t have access to a photographer? You can substitute a stock photo from <a href="https://unsplash.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unsplash</a> or <a href="https://www.pexels.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pexels</a> that fits your brand, but generally featuring one of your products is a better idea.</p>



<p>(Make sure you <a class="fl-scroll-link" href="#image-size">optimize it for the web</a>! Large images kill your load speed.)</p>



<p>Also, it should have plenty of room for your copy and call to action, like the one from To Have or To Borrow. Notice how the entire left half of the image is empty space for the text and button? That’s about right.</p>



<p>Once you’re happy with your image, it’s time for the next step.</p>



<h4>Hero Layout Step #2: Craft a Compelling Message</h4>



<p>Your current tagline or message might be converting well. But take this opportunity to revisit it and make it better.</p>



<p>Let’s look at the message from To Have or To Borrow:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Every accessory is custom made for you, whether you rent or purchase.<br>Handcrafted Artisan Accessories for the Modern Bride.</p></blockquote>



<p>To Have or To Borrow knows what their ideal customer wants: custom-made, high-quality accessories for the special day that’s all about them.</p>



<p>But they also know their audience wants to feel modern and unique—hence that headline: the presence of the words <em>handcrafted</em>, <em>artisan</em>, and <em>modern</em> are subtle hints that what you get from To Have or To Borrow is contemporary, crafty, and unique.</p>



<p>Stuck on some examples? <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/06/07/hero-images-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Our friends over at Wordstream have a great post on how to create hero layouts</a>.</p>



<h4>Hero Layout Step #3: Create your Call to Action (CTA)</h4>



<p>Simple is better.</p>



<p>The best calls to action are clearly visible and promote a benefit—while “Shop Now,” “Order Now,” and the like are classics because they work, you should also test things like “find your perfect fit,” “snag it now,” and “yes, I want a new x!”</p>



<p>Your CTA should stand out from the rest of the page—you can test this with live users or <a class="fl-scroll-link" href="#dead-weight">heatmaps</a> to ensure people see and click on it.</p>



<h4>Hero Layout Step #4: Make and Test</h4>



<p>Once you (or your coder/designer) have built the hero layout on your Shopify store, make sure to test it.</p>



<p>Test the call to action to make sure it actually takes your customer to the right place, yes, but also test that it’s converting better than your slider.</p>



<p>(Of course, your page should load a lot faster now too.)</p>



<p>And that’s how you create a Hero Layout.</p>



<p>&#8230;and if you <em>have</em> to keep the carousel (although we think you shouldn’t), at least <a class="fl-scroll-link" href="#lazy-load">lazy load</a> your images.</p>

<p>Take a look at the two bottom sections—<strong>Performance Scores</strong> and <strong>Page Details</strong>.</p>



<p>A&nbsp;<strong>Performance Score</strong> is an overall grade your Shopify store gets from the 2 tools GTMetrix uses to perform its analysis—Google&#8217;s <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Speed Insights</a> and <a href="http://yslow.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YSlow</a>, an open-source website loading testing kit/browser extension.</p>



<p>We typically don&#8217;t pay too much attention to the performance scores.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Page Details</strong> are the more granular data points: the number of seconds it takes to fully load your store, the size of the page, and the number of requests your store had to make in order to fully load.</p>



<p>As you may have guessed, getting these scores as low as possible correlates with a faster store (and fewer lost customers!).</p>



<p>The arrows next to your scores are indicators of how your store measures against an average website; you can hover over the arrows to get more specific information.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="570" height="165" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gtmetrix-data-hover-arrow.png" alt="gtmetrix data hover arrow" class="wp-image-28478" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gtmetrix-data-hover-arrow.png 570w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gtmetrix-data-hover-arrow-300x87.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gtmetrix-data-hover-arrow-24x7.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gtmetrix-data-hover-arrow-36x10.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gtmetrix-data-hover-arrow-48x14.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px" /></figure>

<h3>The Waterfall Chart</h3>



<p>The next section shows you a breakdown of suggestions and scores from Page Speed Insights and YSlow. This is pretty self-explanatory, and we don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the most valuable piece of information.</p>



<p>Instead, click the tab to go to the waterfall chart.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="703" height="80" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gtmetrix-waterfall-tab.png" alt="gtmetrix waterfall tab" class="wp-image-28736" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gtmetrix-waterfall-tab.png 703w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gtmetrix-waterfall-tab-300x34.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gtmetrix-waterfall-tab-24x3.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gtmetrix-waterfall-tab-36x4.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gtmetrix-waterfall-tab-48x5.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 703px) 100vw, 703px" /></figure>



<p>A waterfall chart is a request-by-request visualization of how your store loads.</p>



<p>In other words, you can visually check which of your store&#8217;s elements take the longest to load speed.</p>



<p>(And therefore you know where your greatest returns are!)</p>



<p>The chart, at first glance, can be a little overwhelming:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="954" height="588" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/huemor-waterfall-chart-gtmetrix.png" alt="huemor waterfall chart gtmetrix" class="wp-image-28769" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/huemor-waterfall-chart-gtmetrix.png 954w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/huemor-waterfall-chart-gtmetrix-300x185.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/huemor-waterfall-chart-gtmetrix-768x473.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/huemor-waterfall-chart-gtmetrix-24x15.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/huemor-waterfall-chart-gtmetrix-36x22.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/huemor-waterfall-chart-gtmetrix-48x30.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 954px) 100vw, 954px" /></figure>



<p>We suggest looking at <a href="https://gtmetrix.com/blog/how-to-read-a-waterfall-chart-for-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GTMetrix&#8217;s guide to reading a waterfall chart</a>.</p>



<p>The two most important things to pay attention to are the <strong>brown</strong> and <strong>purple</strong> colors.</p>



<p><strong>Brown</strong> is for&nbsp;<em>blocking</em> elements. JavaScript and CSS can sometimes be <em>render-blocking</em>; that is, they prevent the rest of the page from loading until they&#8217;re done.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="485" height="317" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gtmetrix-blocking-async-loading.png" alt="gtmetrix blocking async loading" class="wp-image-28346" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gtmetrix-blocking-async-loading.png 485w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gtmetrix-blocking-async-loading-300x196.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gtmetrix-blocking-async-loading-24x16.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gtmetrix-blocking-async-loading-36x24.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gtmetrix-blocking-async-loading-48x31.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px" /></figure>



<p>This creates a bottleneck unless you&#8217;re loading asynchronously. Not ideal.</p>



<p>Using <a class="fl-scroll-link" href="#gtm">Google Tag Manager</a> to asynchronously load your tracking snippets and <a class="fl-scroll-link" href="#minify-assets" rel=" noopener">minifying your JavaScript and CSS</a> can reduce or eliminate the amount of blocking time.</p>



<p><strong>Purple</strong> is for&nbsp;<em>waiting</em>. In GTMetrix, it refers to something called the&nbsp;<em>time to first byte</em> (TTFB), which is how long it takes for your store to receive the first byte of data from whichever resource it&#8217;s loading from.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="389" height="392" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gtmetrix-wait-time.png" alt="gtmetrix wait time" class="wp-image-28464" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gtmetrix-wait-time.png 389w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gtmetrix-wait-time-298x300.png 298w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gtmetrix-wait-time-150x150.png 150w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gtmetrix-wait-time-24x24.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gtmetrix-wait-time-36x36.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gtmetrix-wait-time-48x48.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></figure>



<p>You can reduce your waiting times by <a class="fl-scroll-link" href="#hosting">upgrading your Shopify hosting plan</a>. (You could also switch your content-delivery network (CDN), but the Shopify CDN already performs quite well!)</p>

<h2>Web design vs web development: what the hell&#8217;s the difference?</h2>



<p>Often times the terms &#8220;Web Design&#8221; and &#8220;Web Development&#8221; are used interchangeably. This can create breakdowns in communication and prohibit clients and web design companies from having effective conversations. Especially during the process of <a href="/blog/website-redesign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">effectively planning a website redesign</a>.</p>



<span id="more-29765"></span>



<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll be discussing web design vs web development, the roles of web designers vs web developers, and how to keep the terms straight.</p>



<p>Let’s start with an analogy.</p>



<p>You’ve got yourself a stunning dark grey Jaguar E-Type with all the bells and whistles. It&#8217;s a pretty car – but it&#8217;s more than that. The aesthetic speaks to you. The lines, the materials, the logo. It all seems to be<em> just right.</em></p>



<p>You slide into the leather driver’s seat and prepare to take to the open road. You turn the key and hear your engine roar. A feeling reverberates through you. You&#8217;re off, enjoying a spring afternoon with the roof down – life is good.</p>



<p>In this metaphor, web design is the <em>look and feel</em>, and web development is <em>the engine</em>.</p>



<p>You need both to be top-notch in order to deliver an excellent driving experience.</p>



<p>Now, with the understanding of &#8220;design&#8221; as being the look and feel, and &#8220;development&#8221; being the engine, let&#8217;s take a deeper dive into the individuals in each role.</p>



<h3>The Role of a Web Designer</h3>



<p>It&#8217;s understandable why people are confused by the term &#8220;Web Designer&#8221;. The role of a web designer has evolved quite a bit, often blurring the lines between web designer vs web developer. In general, a web designer spearheads the user experience planning and visual aspects of your websites design.</p>



<p>Web designers plan the overall user journey and site structure, as well as focus on a color scheme, typography, layout, and images. Web design governs what the user will ultimately see on their device when they arrive at your site. It&#8217;s also the main driver of business goals, such as <a href="/blog/lead-generation-resources-for-b2b-websites" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generating more leads</a> or improving online sales.</p>



<p>Designers are looking to keep an overall consistency (repetition or rhythm) of the entire site, so it doesn’t feel like every page belongs to a different site entirely. There is unity in the layout, which helps the human brain organize the information they are processing on the site.</p>



<p>Web designers stick to a theme for the site that speaks to the target audience, and finds relevant images for the subject matter, ensuring no inconsistencies. The web design is the first impression a visitor will get of the brand, and if they like what they see, they might stay around longer to explore the product or service offerings.</p>



<h4>Summarizing A Web Designer’s Personality</h4>



<p>Designers view, interact and visually process the world. If they were to give you directions to their home, they would most likely describe the physical landmarks you would pass on your way.</p>



<p>They rely strongly on their intuition. They are driven by how they ‘feel’ about something when creating the look and feel of their designs.</p>



<p>Trade in ‘big ideas.&#8217; They can visualize every aspect of the user experience – how they would experience the overall ‘vibe’ of the website along with every component that contributes to making the whole. Here&#8217;s a list of some common traits for web designers:</p>



<ul><li>Trust their gut instincts</li><li>Ability to speak in front of a crowd</li><li>Make decisions based on social considerations</li><li>Express emotions easily</li><li>Flourish with out-of-the-box thinking</li><li>Doesn’t like too much structure or following ‘norms.&#8217;</li><li>Sees structure as a limitation to creativity</li><li>Entrepreneurs</li><li>A knack for knowing what people want</li><li>Expressive extrovert artistic masters</li></ul>



<h3>The Role of a Web Developer</h3>



<p>Once the planning and design process has been completed, the web developer, often called programmers, step in and build a fully functioning website from the design.</p>



<p>They bring the vision to life. The design is non-interactive at this point, and the developer starts the engine and begins fueling the process towards an interactive user experience. The web developer can use HTML for the process or make use of programming languages like PHP or a CMS (content management system) like WordPress, which gives the client the opportunity to update and maintain their website without the need for a developer for every change or addition.</p>



<p>There are two types of web developers working on a site&#8217;s functionality –front-end (client-side) and backend (service-side). You might find that some web designers are also proficient at front-end developing, understanding the ins and outs of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>



<p>Web developers may convert a static layout into a dynamic website by using image and content sliders, active states for links and buttons, and other interactive elements.</p>



<p>The backend developer has a specific knowledge of a programming language like Python, Django or Ruby on Rails and also understands databases. The full stack developer is one who is skilled at both front-end and back-end web development. They are the code masters who jumpstart the design into an operating website.</p>



<h4>Summarizing A Web Developer’s Mentality</h4>



<p>The stereotypical image of a developer is a shy, anti-social introvert. But many developers defy these labels and display extrovert tendencies. Here is a list of the more traditional generalizations about the personality of web developers:</p>



<ul><li>Logical</li><li>Scientific</li><li>Analytical</li><li>Obsessed with data</li><li>Black-and-white worldview</li><li>Efficient</li><li>Takes one step at a time</li><li>Pays attention to details</li><li>Thinking</li><li>Structured –loves planning</li><li>Achieves goals in a predictable way</li><li>Relies upon tried and tested techniques to get the job done</li><li>Slower to speak their mind</li><li>Smart decision-makers, weighing up all the options before sharing it with the rest of the team</li></ul>



<h3>Web Designers + Web Developers: How They Collaborate Throughout A Project</h3>



<h4>Project Planning &amp; Strategy</h4>



<p>Devising an effective project strategy requires strong collaboration from both designers and developers.</p>



<p>But before web designers start the creative process, there has to be a solid plan in place.&nbsp;For the planning phase, web designers have to understand their client’s website goals and objectives clearly before moving on to the next stage called Information Architecture (IA), which will ultimately impact and guide the design phase.</p>



<p>Web Developers are expected to contribute to this process by outlining the technical requirements of the project, and sourcing technology that matches the challenge. Developers also work towards shaping the designer&#8217;s ideas based on the platform they&#8217;re using to solve the client challenge.</p>



<p>With both business and technical challenges identified, the designer can get down to the visual nuts and bolts of the site.</p>



<p>They&#8217;re working to create a balanced layout with contrasting colors which will draw attention to critical areas of the website, like CTA’s. Emphasis is also used to highlight specific areas of the page. Designers are looking to keep an overall consistency (repetition or rhythm) of the entire site, so it doesn’t feel like every page belongs to a different site entirely.</p>



<p>After the designer has achieved unity in the layout, they will work with the developer to lay out a guideline that translates the visual information into specifics for the code for the front-end theming and back-end content management support.</p>



<h3>Spotting a Unicorn</h3>



<p>Aptly named a ‘Unicorn’, is a person who is a jack of all trades able to do it all – design and develop (front-end) and are highly sought after individuals in the industry.</p>



<p>They are fluent in the language of both design and development, offering greater team communication and a workflow process that is smooth.</p>



<p>However, just because they can do everything doesn’t mean that they should. Sometimes it’s great to have a unicorn involved in smaller projects where they can take the project from concept to mock-ups to front-end development on their own. For more significant projects, it might be more productive to have separate individuals taking on the different roles of design and development.</p>



<h3>A Typical Project Breakdown</h3>



<p>Alright, so how do these two different folks work together successfully? Let&#8217;s say there&#8217;s a client project for <a href="https://magnetoitsolutions.com/solutions/laundry-app-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laundry app development</a>. The designer/UX would be focused on interviewing potential customers, creating user personas, user flows, and the visual design. The developer would be focused on the research required for technical specifications, back-end development, front-end development, and technical quality assurance.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Web Design Vs Web Development: The Take-Away</h3>



<p>Now that you have a better understanding of web design vs web development, as well as the personality characteristics of web designers vs web developers.</p>



<p>These broad-stroke personality characteristics of web designers and developers lean strongly towards stereotypes. We have definitely all met these individuals in the digital world.</p>



<p>Although some of these are natural traits portrayed in the different jobs – some of these personality traits can be learned over time. They can be developed through educational input or nurtured by a mentor on the team.</p>



<p>One doesn’t want to say that an introvert would not make a great designer because we have seen evidence that there are introverts in these positions and vice versa. As long as an individual has a passion for the job of either developer or designer he/she can excel in any role they choose.</p>



<p>The strength of any team is always in their diversity of personalities, perspectives, and approach to work. Knowing the mentality of web designers and web developers will help you better understand the dynamics when you next decide to have a new website created for your company!</p>
