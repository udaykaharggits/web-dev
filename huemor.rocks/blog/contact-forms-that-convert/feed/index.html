Hey Ray!

First of all, thanks for reading the article and taking the time to reply.

Secondly, I can understand your frustration. Not everyone is equipped to handle a redesign, and it sounds like you&#039;re unhappy with the state of the current site. This process should be really well thought through and executed to not only ensure you get an end result you&#039;re happy with but something that actually moves the needle in terms of your goals.

I&#039;d start by checking out our article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://huemor.rocks/blog/website-redesign/&quot;&gt;how to plan for a website redesign&lt;/a&gt;.

If you&#039;re interested in learning more about how we can specifically help you out feel free to reach out to our sales team to &lt;a href=&quot;https://huemor.rocks/contact&quot;&gt;book a consultation&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

We asked our web master to quote for providing two interactive tools - she said - go find a graphic designer,
We want a modern  contemporary look and feel to any re-design  - with better use of video - interactive tools - downloadable e-books - so we can set up ppc.
A local web designer provided a quote of about 10 lines which does not provide any indication of how they will go about improving the site.
We would like to know :-
Where are we now with analytics
How can improve the site so it is highly responsive and that we receive monthly feedback
