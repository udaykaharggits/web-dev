Non-personal information means information that does not directly identify you. We collect both types of information about you. The following provides some examples of the type of information that we collect and what we use that information for:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Types of Data, Purpose for Collection, and Use of Data<\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>Business Contact Information<\/h4>\n<p>We collect business contact information, and billing information, from our clients and our potential clients for a legitimate business purpose. We use this information in order to provide products, services, or information about our products and services.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>Potential Candidates<\/h4>\n<p>Huemor gathers personal data about individuals who might be interested in a current, or future, position with an Huemor client. Such information includes address, contact information, job role, function, social media presence, work or educational experiences that may be relevant in a candidate search.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>Email Interconnectivity<\/h4>\n<p>If you receive an email from us, we may use certain tools to capture data related to when you open our message or click on any links or banners\/images within it.

We use both session cookies (which expire once a web browser is closed) and persistent cookies (which stay on a device until deleted). Among other things, cookies allow us to provide a more personal and interactive experience and to improve our marketing efforts. Persistent cookies may be removed by following instructions provided by the browser. If cookies are disabled some areas or features of our websites may not work properly.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We collect personal information about you from a variety of sources, including when you visit our website, when you voluntarily provide information to us, when information is publicly posted (e.g., Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.), or when we receive it from third parties such as our clients.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>There may be instances in which the information that we collect is considered sensitive personal data under the laws of the country or state in which you reside. As a general matter, we only collect sensitive personal data when it is necessary for us to do so.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Use of Information<\/h3>\n<p>In addition to the purposes and uses described above, we may use personal information in the following ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>To contact individuals who may be interested in an opportunity to be employed by one of our clients.<\/li>\n<li>To respond to your inquiries related to support, employment opportunities, or other requests.<\/li>\n<li>To provide the products and services you request.<\/li>\n<li>To improve our services and product offerings.<\/li>\n<li>To conduct analytics.<\/li>\n<li>To send marketing and promotional materials, including information relating to our goods, services, sales, or promotions.<\/li>\n<li>For internal administrative purposes, as well as to manage our relationship with you.<\/li>\n<li>To, in an aggregated or anonymized form, generate industry reports about trends such as trends in hiring and compensation.<\/li>\n<li>To assess whether you may become a potential client in the future.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As discussed in the sections above, our collection and processing of your information is based in different contexts upon your consent, our need to perform a contract, our obligations under the law, and\/or our legitimate interest in conducting our business.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Sharing of Information<\/h3>\n<p>In addition to the specific situations discussed elsewhere in this policy, we disclose information in the following situations:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>Affiliates and Acquisitions<\/h4>\n<p>Companies affiliated with Huemor may use the information in connection with processing your inquiries, providing services, and improving our products and services.

We may also share your information if another company acquires our company, business, or our assets.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>Clients<\/h4>\n<p>Huemor may share information about Potential Candidates with its clients. Huemor clients determine what (if any) additional third parties will receive such information.\u2028Other Potential Employers or Leads to Employers.

These third parties may also collect information directly from you as described in this Privacy Policy over time and across different websites. The privacy policy of these third-party companies applies to their collection, use and disclosure of your information. For example, one of our partners is Google Analytics which collects information anonymously and reports website trends without identifying individual visitors.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Retention of Information<\/h3>\n<p>We retain personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law, or an individual requests that we delete information about them.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Protecting Information<\/h3>\n<p>Huemor uses industry-standard security technologies and procedures to ensure data security and integrity for personal data. Huemor also uses reasonable organizational, technical, and administrative measures to protect against unauthorized access, misuse, loss, disclosure, alteration, and destruction of personal information (under its control) about users of its online client services. Unfortunately, data transmission over the Internet cannot be guaranteed as 100% secure. Therefore, while Huemor strives to protect your personal data, Huemor cannot guarantee the security of personal information. In the event that Huemor is required to notify you about a situation involving your data, Huemor may do so by email, telephone, or mail to the extent permitted by law.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Your Choices<\/h3>\n<p>You can make the following choices regarding your personal information:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Access, Correction, and\/or Deletion of Your Personal Information.

You may object to our continued processing of your personal data. If we receive an objection, we will evaluate whether we are required by law to discontinue such processing.<\/li>\n<li>California Residents.

If we use your information for a materially different purpose than it was collected, we will offer you the ability to either opt-in or opt-out of such a use, as required by law.<br \/>\nTransmitting Information to Other Countries<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Personal information may be processed in a country where you do not reside that has privacy laws that may be less stringent than the laws in your country.
