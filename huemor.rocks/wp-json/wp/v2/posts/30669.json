The most straightforward way to accomplish this is to keep your form structure short.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By limiting the number of fields the user has to fill out upfront, the likelihood of form completion goes up by as much as 50%, as verified by a study from<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/blog\/tabid\/6307\/bid\/6746\/Which-Types-of-Form-Fields-Lower-Landing-Page-Conversions.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Hubspot<\/a> that tested the effect of reducing the number of fields from 4 to 3.

This improves the rhythm in which the user can easily read, understand, and progress through your forms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your site visitors and potential customers are not super likely to complete any long forms and will decrease your average conversion rate.

Don\u2019t do this \u2014 it hurts the user experience when they forget what field they\u2019re filling out. It adds friction to the process when they have to erase their answers to verify they\u2019re filling out the right field. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to this<a href=\"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2557265\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> study from Google<\/a>, the most usable web forms have field labels above the corresponding input fields for quick reference.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Use Placeholder Text Effectively<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of using the placeholder text to repeat the label name, you should instead use it to present ideal formatting clues. This will ensure that the data entered in the fields better matches your ideal, making it easier for you to sort the information you\u2019ve gathered. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is especially relevant for fields that deal with information that can be formatted in many different ways, such as dates. Do you want them to enter January 3, 2022, 01\/03\/22, 03\/01\/2022, or 01-03-2022? Alternatively, you can also utilize dropdown menus to lessen confusion over formatting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Have Clear Active States<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"633\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Clear-Active-State@2x-1024x633.jpg\" alt=\"Clear Active State@2x\" class=\"wp-image-30733\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Clear-Active-State@2x-1024x633.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Clear-Active-State@2x-300x185.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Clear-Active-State@2x-768x475.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Clear-Active-State@2x-1536x950.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Clear-Active-State@2x-24x15.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Clear-Active-State@2x-36x22.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Clear-Active-State@2x-48x30.jpg 48w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Clear-Active-State@2x.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When your user is actively editing a form field, make sure there are clear visual cues for them to know what they\u2019re editing.

If you think it should be green to match the rest of the page, then stop right there. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best color for a call to action button, as reviewed by<a href=\"https:\/\/optinmonster.com\/which-color-button-converts-best\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> OptinMonster<\/a>, is one that stands out from the rest of the page. In our previous example, the best color would be red, as it\u2019s the complementary color on the opposite side of the color wheel. This helps draw attention and make the button obvious and visible to your users. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should also ensure that the button has clear states for hover and click for even more visibility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An additional tip for increasing the effectiveness of your call to action button is adding a<a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/how-to-use-testimonials\/s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> testimonial<\/a> within the page. A good testimonial might just be the final push for someone to make that click as social proof can boost the number of sign ups your form gets (and your sales team will thank you later!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Optimize Your Fields for Mobile<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.perficient.com\/insights\/research-hub\/mobile-vs-desktop-usage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> 68% of global website visits came from mobile<\/a> instead of desktop. This means that when you want to make a<a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/top-b2b-website-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> truly great B2B website<\/a>, you need to make sure it looks good on a mobile device. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure your contact forms are optimized and you\u2019re taking advantage of the right mobile keyboard functions per field and a user can easily cycle through the fields on their device. Since to make your short form mobile friendly you have to find of how mobile responsive your form is, due to this you might need to create a mobile version of your form that allows mobile users the ease of use when they are answering your form. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This may end up differing from the desktop version of your web form.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Make Sure There\u2019s a Clear Confirmation<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s frustrating when you click submit on a contact form and the website doesn\u2019t tell you whether or not it worked. Should you wait and see if it gives you any confirmation? Should you fill it in again?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When your user completes the form, it should be obvious to them. An entirely separate \u201cthank you\u201d page is the most preferable option as well as one of the form design best practices for form completion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What Form Fields You Actually Need<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we\u2019re done with the general conversion tips, you might be thinking \u201cEveryone says \u2018make your form shorter,\u2019 but what fields do I actually need to keep?\u201d Let\u2019s start with what people don\u2019t like filling out:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"633\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/What-Form-Fields-You-Actually-Need@2x-1024x633.jpg\" alt=\"What Form Fields You Actually Need@2x\" class=\"wp-image-30704\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/What-Form-Fields-You-Actually-Need@2x-1024x633.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/What-Form-Fields-You-Actually-Need@2x-300x185.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/What-Form-Fields-You-Actually-Need@2x-768x475.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/What-Form-Fields-You-Actually-Need@2x-1536x950.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/What-Form-Fields-You-Actually-Need@2x-24x15.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/What-Form-Fields-You-Actually-Need@2x-36x22.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/What-Form-Fields-You-Actually-Need@2x-48x30.jpg 48w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/What-Form-Fields-You-Actually-Need@2x.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the era of data privacy concerns, people are more and more hesitant to give out information like phone numbers and address information. Even if you leave a note that says \u201cWe value your privacy. Your information is safe and will never be shared,\u201d the person filling out your form has to take that promise at face value because you haven\u2019t earned their trust yet. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your contact form is currently asking for personal data, you\u2019re likely putting yourself at a disadvantage. Asking for this information runs the risk of scaring off your users but it remains a<a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/biggest-website-redesign-mistakes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> common website mistake<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In reality, most B2B contact forms only need the following information:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Name<\/li><li>Email Address<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Seriously, that\u2019s it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that doesn\u2019t feel like enough information, let\u2019s talk about how you can gain more while still keeping your form as short as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How To Improve Lead Quality<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you now have a name and an email address. That\u2019s plenty of information to start with \u2014 provided you use the correct tools.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Use Email Automation To Further Qualify<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting people to fill in your contact form is the initial goal, but your overall goal is to nurture your leads and eventually convince them to buy your product or service. The first step to getting more information out of an email address is setting up email automation. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By using email automation to follow up on form submissions, you immediately accomplish two things: you ensure that the email address they submitted is valid and you begin the sales process.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A crucial component to the latter objective is sending a personalized email instead of a dry general email. This immediately starts building trust and start to increase conversions. You can even use it to ask 3-5 additional questions you may need to know to qualify the prospect. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example of an e-mail we automatically send after someone fills out a form:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-624748239d780 wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-container-624748239d1ee wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p><em>Hi First_Name,<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>To make sure we understand what you&#8217;re looking for, please share some information about your project:<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>Are you looking for a single project or ongoing work?

However, what if you absolutely need that data? Applying contact form best practices to a form that requires more than 10 entries requires the use of multi-step forms with multiple fields.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After being told that you only truly need a name and an email address on the contact form, you might be confused as to why you would ever need a form long enough that it requires multiple steps. The reasoning is simple \u2014 it depends heavily on the purpose of your contact form.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine that you\u2019re shopping around for an estimate on the value of your house. You see a real estate agency that promises a free online estimate, but the only thing their form asks is a name and an email address. What insight could they possibly offer you with only that information?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Multi-step forms are amazing solutions for longer forms, such as an application or registration form. They\u2019re also a good way to get more information from your leads \u2014 starting with \u201clow-friction\u201d or \u201clow-threat\u201d (e.g. what service are you looking for?) fields. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These can engage them and allow you to ask more sensitive questions near the end when it\u2019s less likely for them to back out because they\u2019ve already invested time and effort. Multi-step forms that include a progress bar are also effective at getting users to complete forms, due to the \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/10.1086\/500480\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">endowed progress effect<\/a>.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When making a multi-step form, the same conversion tips apply. You should keep each batch of fields short so you don\u2019t overwhelm the user. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A case study from<a href=\"http:\/\/ventureharbour.com\/multi-step-lead-forms-get-300-conversions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Venture Harbour<\/a> saw a 53% increase in conversion rate when they formatted 30+ questions in a four-step form. Data from<a href=\"https:\/\/www.formstack.com\/resources\/report-form-conversion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Formstack<\/a> backs this up \u2014 multi-step forms have a completion rate of 13.85%, compared to 4.53% on a single long form.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Why &amp; When To Use Embedded Forms<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many businesses keep separate<a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/blog\/service-page-design-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> service pages<\/a> and contact form pages. However, forms that are directly embedded in landing pages tend to outperform CTAs to open a separate contact form page. The reasoning is, as always, convenience.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever you can, you should try and incorporate a contact form directly on key landing pages, ideally above the fold of the page and again at the bottom of the landing page. It should also stand out from the rest of the web page elements so your user can find it easily.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re following the previously highlighted conversion tips (i.e. keeping forms concise), then this should be relatively easy to accomplish from a design perspective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How To Keep Forms Secure (Without Hurting Conversions)<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On paper, Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart or CAPTCHAs are a great way to reduce spam and ensure you\u2019re getting quality information from your form, but did you know that visible CAPTCHAs actually hurt conversion rates?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"633\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x-1024x633.jpg\" alt=\"How To Keep Forms Secure@2x\" class=\"wp-image-30706\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x-1024x633.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x-300x185.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x-768x475.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x-1536x950.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x-24x15.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x-36x22.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x-48x30.jpg 48w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>According to this case study from<a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/captchas-affect-on-conversion-rates\"> Moz<\/a>, having CAPTCHA on reduced the amount of spam conversions by 4.1% but companies could actually lose out on 3.2% of genuine conversions. This is likely because CAPTCHA has become too difficult and confusing, in an effort to combat the increasing sophistication of spambots. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It simply isn\u2019t user-friendly \u2014 who wants to take the time to puzzle over a distorted set of letters or numbers and painstakingly type them out?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of using CAPTCHA, you can look to alternatives that are convenient or invisible to the front-end user but still keep spam and brute force attacks at bay. One such example is Google\u2019s<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2014\/12\/3\/7325925\/google-is-killing-captcha-as-we-know-it\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> reCAPTCHA<\/a>, which can be as simple as clicking a checkbox.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Tracking Performance &amp; Making Improvements<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever you make any type of changes to your contact forms, it is downright impossible to truly understand their impact without tracking performance. Here are three key tests and methods you should be using to track improvements:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Set Up Goals<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Using<a href=\"https:\/\/analytics.google.com\/analytics\/web\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Google Analytics<\/a> (or your preferred analytics tool), make sure each form on your website has a unique goal attached to it for completion. This will give you a better understanding of the success rate of filling out these forms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Use Behavior Tracking<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Using tools like<a href=\"https:\/\/www.hotjar.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Hotjar<\/a> or<a href=\"https:\/\/www.luckyorange.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> LuckyOrange<\/a> will provide you with a better understanding of how people are interacting with your contact forms in real-time. This could help you identify drop-off points or even bugs within the forms themselves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Split Test<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Tools like<a href=\"https:\/\/www.optimizely.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Optimizely<\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/vwo.com\/platform\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> VWO<\/a>, and<a href=\"https:\/\/www.convert.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Convert<\/a> allow you to easily and effectively set up split tests. In these scenarios, you can run variations of form configurations side by side and understand how they truly are performing. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Split tests can help you pinpoint which elements of your contact forms help or harm your conversion rate. The more tests you perform, the better optimized your form will be by the end.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Wrapping Up<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>That finishes our rundown of contact form best practices. Contact forms are one of the biggest opportunities for businesses to improve both the quality and quantity of leads, so make sure you never neglect to optimize them. Always keep these three conversion tips in mind:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Keep them as concise as possible.<\/li><li>Use other methods to get the additional info you need.<\/li><li>Test and monitor all of your improvements to maximize your results.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, at the end of the day a good contact form is one that provides a pleasant user experience, and you can\u2019t have that with clunky fields or long pages.
