Reviews, on the other hand, allow customers to read others&#8217; experiences and glean information from them that they might not otherwise get.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, you might see comments like: \u201cthe shoe was stiff and took about a week to break in\u201d or \u201cthe color was slightly darker than how it looked in the photo\u201d or \u201cthe material is even softer than I expected\u201d and so on.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"caption\"><img class=\"wp-image-19275 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn2.hubspot.net\/hubfs\/6606556\/Imported_Blog_Media\/5-Social.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1656\" height=\"492\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.allbirds.com\/products\/womens-wool-runners\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Allbirds<\/a> uses a social Instagram feed on each product page so customers can see photos of other people wearing the shoes they\u2019re looking at.<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin: 0px 40px;\">\n<h4><span style=\"color: #888a93;\">18&nbsp;<\/span>Social engagement builds trust and credibility<\/h4>\n<p>Social media is amazing, both for customer service and for connecting directly to your audience. Depending on the platform (Facebook, Instagram, etc.), you have the ability to respond to any reviews that come in and to address questions and negative reviews in a timely manner.

It allows the brand to seem more accessible because it shows that there are real people using it.<\/p>\n<p>UGC is also a way for the brand to amass great content and imagery they might not otherwise have.
