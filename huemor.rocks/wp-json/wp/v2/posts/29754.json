While Cyber Monday is still a huge event, we must agree that the power of ecommerce to successfully drive revenue has never been greater.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look at the effects the behemoth Amazon has had on the consumer and the retail industry. Amazon is now more than just a giant online retailer, it\u2019s a marketing company that\u2019s changing the ways consumers research, plan, and shop. Many consumers are even choosing Amazon over Google as the first place to go when they research a product. Think about that!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you may not be Amazon, taking advantage of this power is key to your business succeeding and following the steps below will ensure your ecommerce business succeeds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Where Does Your Brand Stand?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the reasons brand loyalty is hard to attain and keep today is consumers are smarter and better equipped to find deals that are best for their wallets. They\u2019re finding the products they need and want, often at a cheaper price.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For ecommerce enterprises, this newly informed consumer means that competition is fierce. But it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t position your business to succeed and win in this market. It simply means you need to have a better understanding of exactly where your brand stands in the consumer\u2019s eyes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do they even know who you are? More importantly\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Do You Know Who You Are?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Who are you? What is your brand strategy, and how does it differentiate you from the pack? Does your business have a mission? What problem does your product solve, and what do your customers think about it and you?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an ideal world, you\u2019ll want to be able to answer these questions easily and without much thought because they\u2019re vital to your online company\u2019s existence and your success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, many companies have trouble truly differentiating themselves in the marketplace. If you\u2019re having trouble with this differentiation, you better believe your prospective customers will have this issue as well. Your customers want you to stand out and stand for something. That\u2019s where positioning comes into play.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Positioning Your Brand<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>How you position yourself through your brand strategy is key for customer acquisition and customer retention\u2014it informs the next steps you should take before you think about any other parts of your business from marketing to sales.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After you\u2019ve determined where you want to be positioned, start building your brand strategy for an <a href=\"https:\/\/insights.huemor.rocks\/ecommerce-website-cost\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">effective ecommerce redesign<\/a>. Successful brand strategies can include zeroing in on your unique selling proposition or personalizing your customer\u2019s experience among.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Let\u2019s Examine These Two Strategies In A Bit More Detail:<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Your Unique Selling Proposition (USP) differentiates your brand from the competition and it should highlight something unique about your business and product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is to not compete in a jammed packed space. Stand out and make prospects come to you by offering something so unique, they want to come back. This is your sweet spot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Personalizing the customer experience is another example of a brand strategy helps you acquire and retain customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Align your product and brand closer to the customer by giving them exactly what they want based on what they like and who they are. Matching your identity to theirs means you\u2019ve crushed your product branding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are three examples of ecommerce companies with brand strategies that include USPs and customer personalization that stand out:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"585\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/bomboas-homepage-compressor-1024x585.jpg\" alt=\"bomboas homepage compressor\" class=\"wp-image-28298\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/bomboas-homepage-compressor-1024x585.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/bomboas-homepage-compressor-300x171.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/bomboas-homepage-compressor-768x439.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/bomboas-homepage-compressor-1536x878.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/bomboas-homepage-compressor-24x14.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/bomboas-homepage-compressor-36x21.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/bomboas-homepage-compressor-48x27.jpg 48w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/bomboas-homepage-compressor.jpg 1585w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bombas&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/bombas.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">\u2192<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019ve never heard of Bombas, you\u2019re not a fan of socks.
