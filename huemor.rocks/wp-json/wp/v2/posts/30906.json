For your business, this will likely be more complex, but the approach to solving this should be the same.<\/p><div class=\"huemorProtip-button\"><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The Persona<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>AlphaX is an enterprise SaaS company focused on helping businesses improve their supply chain woes. This software, coupled with their onboarding fee averages $30,000 per deal in year one, and 90% of their customers stick around for multiple years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the course of 2021, their company experienced a ton of organic growth due to emerging supply chain challenges during the pandemic. Their top-line revenue soared to $20M annually.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This growth, while increasing revenue, have also increased their overhead.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Defining The Goals<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Business Goal<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking forward to 2022, AlphaX\u2019s CEO has set a revenue growth goal of 20% year-over-year to ensure the company remains healthy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s now up to the marketing team to deliver. Where do they start?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Sales Goal<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned above, AlphaX\u2019s CEO has set a goal of 20% YoY growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means their new top-line revenue at the end of 2022 should be $24M annually (a total increase of $4,000,000).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a retention rate of 90% per year and an average of $30k per new deal, that means AlphaX will need to sign 200 new deals in 2022 to make this goal a reality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Marketing Goal<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing the target revenue and deals required to get there, it\u2019s now the marketing team&#8217;s job to figure out what this means in terms of their marketing funnel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After looking at a collective of both their CRM and Analytics tools, they\u2019ve uncovered the following information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>3% of their visitors fill out a demo form.<\/li><li>85% of those who fill out a demo form book a demo call.<\/li><li>90% of those who attend a demo call are interested in a proposal.<\/li><li>40% of proposals submitted turn into paying customers.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>With this information in hand, they\u2019re now equipped to figure out based on historical data what their marketing goals should be.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Understanding The Numbers<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal is to acquire 200 new customers, so let\u2019s use that to identify each stage of our funnel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s start by looking at the close rate. 40% of proposals translate into a new customer. That means AlphaX will need to send out 500 additional proposals in 2022.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, let\u2019s look at the interest level after a demo is presented. 90% of people want a proposal, which means 556 additional demos will need to be booked.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, let\u2019s look at how many people confirm a demo call after they fill out a form. 85% of people do that, which means 654 additional demo forms need to be submitted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, let\u2019s look at how many people fill out a demo form after visiting the website. 3% of people do that, which means 21,800 additional unique people need to visit the website per year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that information, we now have additional targets for each stage of our funnel per annum:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Visitors: 21,800<\/li><li>Demo Form Submits: 654<\/li><li>Demo Presentations: 556<\/li><li>Proposals Sent: 500<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Monthly, we&#8217;re looking at an extra&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Visitors: 1,816<\/li><li>Demo Form Submits: 55<\/li><li>Demo Presentations: 46<\/li><li>Proposals Sent: 42 <\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The 20% goal is starting to get less scary, right? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"huemorProtip-container\" style=\"background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><h2 class=\"huemorProtip-title\" style=\"color:black\">Protip<\/h2><p style=\"color:black\" class=\"huemorProtip-description\">Oftentimes when running new campaigns, numbers may perform worse than historical recordings. We suggest adding a 10-15% buffer to your goals and then re-evaluating quarterly to continue to fine-tune your goals.<\/p><div class=\"huemorProtip-button\"><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What If I Don\u2019t Have This Data?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ideally, in order for this approach to work, a company needs to have good tracking mechanisms in place. This means you have to have both accurate analytics and a CRM that\u2019s kept up to date.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don\u2019t have those in place within your organization, a low-cost and effective way to set this up would be subscribing to a tool like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pipedrive.com\/\">Pipedrive<\/a> and making sure <a href=\"https:\/\/analytics.google.com\/\">Google Analytics<\/a> is installed on your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don\u2019t have this data, then I\u2019d start with figuring out the following:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Average Deal Value<\/li><li>Total Increase<\/li><li>Deal Number<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, figure out what your close rate is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, you can do some research on what percentages are average for the various stages in your industry. For most B2B\u2019s, we\u2019ve observed the following:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Form Submissions: 1-3%<\/li><li>Booked Calls: 50-70%<\/li><li>Proposals: 60-80%<\/li><li>Close Rate: 20-30%&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"huemorProtip-container\" style=\"background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><h2 class=\"huemorProtip-title\" style=\"color:black\">Protip<\/h2><p style=\"color:black\" class=\"huemorProtip-description\">When starting a lead generation initiative many people are focused on improving their top-of-funnel metrics (visits). In reality, it&#8217;s likely easier to improve your mid-to-bottom funnel metrics (form submissions, booked calls, and close rate) <\/p><div class=\"huemorProtip-button\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link\" href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/roi-calculator\/\">See How Conversion Rate Impacts Your Bottom Line<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Wrapping Up<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By following the steps above the marketing team was able to demystify their objectives and break things down into concrete numbers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This provides them with a clear understanding of what needs to be accomplished, and will now allow them to ideate on how to make those numbers a reality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you skip this step and jump immediately into tactics, you\u2019re setting yourself up for failure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Math Cheat Sheet<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Total Increase = (Annual Revenue x % Increase)<\/li><li>Deal Number = ((Annual Revenue x % Retention Rate) + (Total Increase) \/ (Average Deal Value))<\/li><li>Proposals Sent = (Deal Number \/ % Close Rate)<\/li><li>Presentations = (Proposals Sent \/ % Interested In Proposal)<\/li><li>Form Submissions = (Presentations \/ % Presentations Booked)<\/li><li>Visitors = (Form Submissions \/ % Form Conversion Rate)<\/li><li>Average Deal Value = (Total Sales \/ Total Number of Sales)<\/li><li>Close Rate = (Number of Deals Won \/ Number of Proposals Sent)<\/li><\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We talk a lot about how strategy and planning matter.
