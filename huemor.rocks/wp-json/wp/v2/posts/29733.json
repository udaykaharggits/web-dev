The amendments or overhauls to your side can be in the coding, content, structure, or site layout. During a website redesign, you may also change the aesthetic aspects of your site like the media and color palette.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the site owner, you want to redesign your website for one purpose \u2014 to attract and retain your audience or clients. A better user interface or experience is the goal of a site redesign.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A site with improved design will have considered data and current best practices. As a result, the product of site redesign is a site that delivers a superior page experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/google-page-experience-update-begins-rolling-out\/410660\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">page experience carries over to better online visibility and traffic.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why do companies redesign their websites?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In many ways, your corporate website is like a pair of shoes. You need them. They can be worthwhile investments \u2014 at least, until you outgrow them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As your business evolves and scales, changes occur. Your brand persona changes, and, so does your customer base. When shifts in your clientele and business goals occur, your website needs to follow suit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is for this reason that you may need to redesign website design in key areas. Web design services like the <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ones we offer<\/a> allow your website to evolve with the times and your changing goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why Is a Site Redesign Important?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It is crucial to give your website a make-over for several reasons. The first reason is to improve the user experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the needs and desires of your clients change, their navigation habits and their tastes can follow suit. Hence, changing your site\u2019s features to appeal to your clients\u2019 needs and tastes will contribute to more traffic and conversions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another reason is to create an image of authority. Site visitors are usually quick to judge based on appearances. It is no coincidence that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.webfx.com\/blog\/web-design\/website-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">credibility and better site design are co-terminus with each other.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Getting Started<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, so now that we&#8217;ve got that out of the way, do you still feel like you&#8217;re at the point where a website redesign is the next right step for your business? If so, read on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ResourceDownload-container\" id=\"ResourceDownload-load\"><h4 class=\"ResourceDownload-subtitle\" style=\"color:#EC4067\">GET THE GOODS<\/h4><h2 class=\"ResourceDownload-title\" style=\"color:black\">Download Our Free Website Redesign Guide + Checklist.<\/h2><div class=\"ResourceDownload-form\">\n<!--[if lte IE 8]>\n<script charset=\"utf-8\" type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"\/\/js.hsforms.net\/forms\/v2-legacy.js\"><\/script>\n<![endif]-->\n<script charset=\"utf-8\" type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"\/\/js.hsforms.net\/forms\/v2.js\"><\/script>\n<script>\n  hbspt.forms.create({\n\tregion: \"na1\",\n\tportalId: \"6606556\",\n\tformId: \"0ac430c7-1ed3-48da-a13b-1b8789dc52c7\"\n});\n<\/script>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter1\"> <\/a>\n<\/div><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">CHAPTER 1<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">The 7 Essential Elements of an Effective Web Design<\/h2><p>Performance is at the heart of every website.<br><br>Every effective website design contains these 6 elements.

Your messaging can make or break that goal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;this means you should invest in a digital marketer or copywriter to help you nail your messaging.

If it costs $2 to get 1 person in your funnel&#8230;that&#8217;s a $30 profit for every $20 you spend. We&#8217;d do that all day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can (and should) automate your entire funnel. Once someone finds you from your website content or your ads, you don&#8217;t need to make any more manual actions. That liberates a lot of time to focus on your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don\u2019t already have any funnels\u2014or if this talk of funnels makes your head spin\u2014check out <a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/blog\/marketing-funnels\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this post we think does a good job of explaining funnels<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"huemorProtip-container\" style=\"background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><h2 class=\"huemorProtip-title\" style=\"color:black\">Protip<\/h2><p style=\"color:black\" class=\"huemorProtip-description\">Funnels can feel overwhelming\u2026but they&#8217;re effective.

Show up in their email inboxes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You build trust online by making the effort to create a connection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Encourage your customers to write positive reviews and comments. Then respond to them&#8230;even the bad ones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Testimonials and success stories are the most important pieces of social proof on your current website.

Following you on social. Buying a product. These are all conversions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conversions are based on trust and messaging. When a prospective customer converts, they move down the funnel and progress along the journey to become a customer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Messaging, a strong brand, a logical funnel, and social proof will net you more conversions&#8230;but it\u2019s ultimately about what you offer and what your customer wants.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;so how does a website redesign project plan help?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Low conversion rates are often a symptom of some issue with your messaging, structure, identity, funnel, or ability to build trust. A website redesign strategy that improves all of those aspects will improve your conversion rates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"huemorProtip-container\" style=\"background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><h2 class=\"huemorProtip-title\" style=\"color:black\">Case Study<\/h2><p style=\"color:black\" class=\"huemorProtip-description\">A 1250% conversion rate increase from a website redesign?

Goals<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The goals you have for your business will determine what you need to change in your site. Anybody can pick and choose which page to change; effective website redesign starts during goal-setting.<br>During goal-setting, it is important to have goals that are specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time-bound. This is where data comes in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data in the form of key performance indicators give you a measurable yardstick for your efforts. By setting certain targets you can measure numerically, you can have a better idea of how to redesign your site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, let us imagine that you want more leads for your business. This is not a bad goal to have, but it can be tough to measure. After all, your website can have thousands of visitors a day, and not one will signify further interest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, by targeting <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/2615875?hl=en#:~:text=Clickthrough%20rate%20(CTR)%20can%20be,your%20CTR%20would%20be%205%25.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">click-through rates<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/10\/dwell-time\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dwell times<\/a>, you can design your site in a way that encourages navigation. As visitors click on other pages and stay on your site, you will know that you have succeeded. These rates are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Measurable<\/li><li>Specific (not ambiguous)<\/li><li>Can be achieved<\/li><li>Can be subject to a time frame<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A good example of S.M.A.R.T goals are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.klipfolio.com\/blog\/define-kpi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">KPIs or Key Performance Indicators<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don&#8217;t have specific KPIs&nbsp;yet, now&#8217;s the time to think of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A vague goal like &#8220;I want more conversions&#8221; is a good place to start but not where you want to end up. It&#8217;s a bad goal because it&#8217;s not quantifiable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"huemorProtip-container\" style=\"background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><h2 class=\"huemorProtip-title\" style=\"color:black\">Protip<\/h2><p style=\"color:black\" class=\"huemorProtip-description\">This worksheet has dozens of exercises to ensure you get crystal clear on what you want from your website revamp.<\/p><div class=\"huemorProtip-button\"><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Your Win Condition<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A win condition is how you\u2019ll measure the success of your redesign.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;but what is a win condition?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A win condition is the single most important business goal on your list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The take-it-or-leave-it item on the agenda.

A website can convey your brand persona or identity to visitors. A brand persona can be understood as personality traits you wish to convey to your visitors.

It\u2019s important to find someone who feels like a fit in terms of personality, expertise, and humility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>1. Personality<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll work with this vendor for a long time. It\u2019s important that you like them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An ideal partner will understand and emulate your values. Many agencies list their values on their website; double check that they align with yours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s also important to pay attention to how they treat you\u2014do they show up late? How do they respond to your questions and concerns? Trust your intuition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a lot of web design agencies. If someone gives you a weird vibe, back away and look for someone else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>2. Expertise<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Plenty of agencies with impressive portfolios might not be the best fit for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your ideal partner should have some success (re)designing websites in your field.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One company might build an awesome travel agency website but lack the acumen to build a stellar ecommerce website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another might not have the A-list clientele you&#8217;d like to see but their ecommerce work might speak for itself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to evaluate each potential partner on their own merits and not in competition with each other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>3. Humility<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Be adamant about getting the best possible product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best agencies to partner with will be humble. They understand that, as the client, your needs come first.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beware the agency whose ego conflicts with your business interests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a vendor immediately talks about their technical prowess or accolades instead of asking you questions about your goals, challenges, or overall strategy, run away. Far away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is not the agency you want to manage your website redesign process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"huemorProtip-container\" style=\"background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><h2 class=\"huemorProtip-title\" style=\"color:black\">Protip<\/h2><p style=\"color:black\" class=\"huemorProtip-description\">Need some more help figuring out what you want in a dream partner?
