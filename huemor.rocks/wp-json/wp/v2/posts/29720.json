The visual they choose to use also summarizes the statement really well.<\/li><li>Their strategy for each section as you scroll down the page is top-notch. They lead with a benefit and then identify what key features help make it happen. They also pair a snippet of their product image to help also visually communicate the point.<\/li><li>For those who may need a bit more information they provide two click-through paths for more information on specific features.<\/li><li>Right before the final CTA on the page they highlight some client testimonials. Not only do these say great things, they look great too.<\/li><li>At the end of the page there are two clear options: Book a Demo or Create a Free account.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>What we&#8217;d change:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Our only critique would be to drop the &#8216;Create A Free Account&#8217; button from the final CTA. You have a persistent version of it in the site header and you also presented it in the initial frame of the page. That leaves room for you to have a strong, singular call to action.<\/li><li>We&#8217;d also suggest testing an in-page form for the &#8216;Book a Demo&#8217; option as opposed to the CTA. It doesn&#8217;t always work flawlessly, but in most cases it can lift conversions on the page.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Aanika<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"538\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Tech-Aanika-min-1024x538.jpg\" alt=\"Tech Aanika min\" class=\"wp-image-28847\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Tech-Aanika-min-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Tech-Aanika-min-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Tech-Aanika-min-768x403.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Tech-Aanika-min-1536x806.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Tech-Aanika-min-2048x1075.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Tech-Aanika-min-24x13.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Tech-Aanika-min-36x19.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Tech-Aanika-min-48x25.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption><span style=\"font-size: 14px; text-align: right;\">Source &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aanikabio.com\/applications\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">aanikabio.com<\/a><\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Aanika&#8217;s futuristic service page layout definitely does a great job of combining aesthetics and marketing copy. Here&#8217;s what we like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The supporting text underneath the header on the page provides a good information about what Aanika actually is.<\/li><li>The graphic supporting the the opening statement is definitely attention grabbing.<\/li><li>They call out specific features early and then speak to their business benefits directly underneath the titles.<\/li><li>Love the idea and content behind the larger benefits section.<\/li><li>&nbsp;They end the page at a clear call to action to get in contact.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>What we&#8217;d suggest to improve:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Adding some sort of subtle motion to the hand would be nice. Something simple like the dots bubbling up or slight movement on the fingers could bring the web design over the top.<\/li><li>The benefits section contents are awesome, but we feel like the presentation could be tightened up. Instead of having each user type (businesses, consumers, the planet) in it&#8217;s own frame, present them together as one in three columns. Also, the points made for each would be more easily read as bullet points.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"huemorProtip-container\" style=\"background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><h2 class=\"huemorProtip-title\" style=\"color:black\">Want Your Service Page Reviewed?<\/h2><p style=\"color:black\" class=\"huemorProtip-description\">Interested in what we may have to say about your website&nbsp;design or service page?

These are pages on your website design that are focused on a single, specific service offering. Some of the quick advantages to these pages are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>They allow you to be hyper focused on a specific topic (service)<\/li><li>They can be heavily optimized for organic search based on specific key terms<\/li><li>They can act as effective first touch points or entrance points for new users<\/li><li>You can really elaborate on your benefits and differentiators here<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, individual service pages are a powerful tool for delivering information to new users. We find that these types of pages get viewed most by new users when they&#8217;re the entry point of the site. A brand new user entering in from your homepage will be less likely to visit these pages on their first website visit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"538\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Frakton-min-1024x538.jpg\" alt=\"Services Frakton min\" class=\"wp-image-28245\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Frakton-min-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Frakton-min-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Frakton-min-768x403.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Frakton-min-1536x806.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Frakton-min-2048x1075.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Frakton-min-24x13.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Frakton-min-36x19.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Frakton-min-48x25.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption><span style=\"font-size: 14px; text-align: right;\">Source &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/frakton.com\/services\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">frakton.com<\/a><\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Service Overview Pages<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Service Overview pages are a single destination that lists out all of the services you offer. These pages are great for first time visitors coming in from somewhere like your home page because they allow the user to quickly understand the breadth of your offerings. We find that these types of pages almost always get a hit from a first time visitor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>URL Structure Best Practices<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For a long time there&#8217;s been some debate surrounding how URLs should be created. Some SEO&#8217;s will suggest that the URL should contain all of your key terms while user experience experts will suggest they&#8217;re as short as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These two ideologies are often in direct contention with one another.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s say you were trying to rank for the term &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/web-design\" rel=\" noopener\">Web Design Services New York<\/a>&#8220;. An SEO might suggest that the URL looks something like this: <span style=\"background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;\">\/web-design-services-new-york<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where an UX expert might suggest the URL looks something like this: <span style=\"background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;\">\/web-design<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>&nbsp;<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<h4>Which URL is right?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Neither is perfect, but the user experience experts suggestion is actually more in-line with modern standards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Search engines have been advancing steadily since their creation. While we don&#8217;t know the keys to their algorithm exactly, we do know that search engines have been moving away from direct match terms as their biggest ranking factors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why? Simply put, it was easy to manipulate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Search engines instead put focus on topical relevance. This relevance can be built&nbsp;in a number of different ways which we talk about <a href=\"#chapter6\" rel=\" noopener\">lower in the article<\/a>, but essentially it comes down to analyzing the whole of the content and grading it on its relevance. Having the extra words in the URL slug itself will yield little to no actual SEO benefit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what should you focus on instead?&nbsp;In general, you should be focusing on your content as topics. Each topic will then have sub-topics associated with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"735\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/graphic-min-1024x735.jpg\" alt=\"graphic min\" class=\"wp-image-28000\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/graphic-min-1024x735.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/graphic-min-300x215.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/graphic-min-768x551.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/graphic-min-24x17.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/graphic-min-36x26.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/graphic-min-48x34.jpg 48w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/graphic-min.jpg 1168w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"color: #00ff03;\"><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"huemorProtip-container\" style=\"background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><h2 class=\"huemorProtip-title\" style=\"color:black\">Pro Tip<\/h2><p style=\"color:black\" class=\"huemorProtip-description\">This article from Hubspot actually does a great job of explaining the nuances in more detail <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/what-is-a-pillar-page\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">in this article<\/a> if you&#8217;re interested.<\/p><div class=\"huemorProtip-button\"><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4>&nbsp;<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<h4>Your Ideal Service Page URL Structure<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>So circling back to the example we listed above, the main topic is &#8216;services&#8217;, and the sub topic is &#8216;web-design&#8217;, as it&#8217;s an individual service. &#8216;New York&#8217; isn&#8217;t really a topic at all, it&#8217;s a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordtracker.com\/academy\/keyword-research\/guides\/keyword-modifiers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">modifier to the term<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That should leave you with a URL like: <span style=\"background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;\">\/services\/web-design<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This URL accomplishes a few interesting things:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It&#8217;s concise, so it fits the short standards of user experience expert<\/li><li>It contains the term &#8216;Services&#8217; so it fits the standards of the SEO expert<\/li><li>Because &#8216;Services&#8217; is included as a parent page, the authority this individual page (sub topic) generates will help pass authority onto it&#8217;s parent page (topic)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you ever thought about URLs this much before?

Don&#8217;t skip it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter3\"><\/a>\n<\/div><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">Chapter 3<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">Creating the Perfect Opening Statement<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>You don&#8217;t have much time to get your audience&#8217;s attention. Just a few seconds, in fact. It&#8217;s easy to get caught up with your website design, but what about your website&#8217;s copy?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The right opening statement makes those seconds count.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where you tell your audience, in as few words as possible, why your service should matter to them. Think of it as an elevator pitch, but with 30 words instead of 30 seconds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What you should avoid:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Treating your service like you would treat a product.<\/li><li>Focusing on &#8216;we&#8217; instead of &#8216;you (the customer).<\/li><li>Focus on features of the service itself, like duration or exact actions.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, focus on the benefits of that service. Put yourself into your audience&#8217;s shoes, and try to understand the reasons why they&#8217;d want to become customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No one gets a haircut because they like the feel of scissors on their scalp. They endure it because of what they get as a result.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Services Solve Problems<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Craft your opening statement based on two basic principles:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Pain<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Your customers hire you because they want to fill a specific need. That need is driven by a deeper pain point. Your copywriting should speak directly to that pain point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Benefit<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This is your pivot. How does your service solve the pain point? What does your audience get from hiring you? If you craft it right, the desire to work with you should come naturally.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"538\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Huemor-min-1024x538.jpg\" alt=\"Services Huemor min\" class=\"wp-image-28246\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Huemor-min-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Huemor-min-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Huemor-min-768x403.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Huemor-min-1536x806.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Huemor-min-2048x1075.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Huemor-min-24x13.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Huemor-min-36x19.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Huemor-min-48x25.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption><span style=\"font-size: 14px; text-align: right;\">Source &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/website-redesigns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">huemor.rocks<\/a><\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s easier said than done.

You can simply dedicate a small portion of the website design to them, subtly reinforcing your expertise in the eyes of everyone who knows the source of the logos.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"538\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Smile.io-min-1024x538.jpg\" alt=\"Services Smile.io min\" class=\"wp-image-28249\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Smile.io-min-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Smile.io-min-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Smile.io-min-768x403.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Smile.io-min-1536x806.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Smile.io-min-2048x1075.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Smile.io-min-24x13.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Smile.io-min-36x19.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Smile.io-min-48x25.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption><span style=\"font-size: 14px; text-align: right;\">Source &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/smile.io\/programs\/vip\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">smile.io<\/a><\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. The Nuanced Reinforcement of Testimonials.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You probably know about testimonials as a core way to build social proof. They take the burden of talking about your benefits from you and put it into the hands of a more easily trusted, independent source.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But are you using them the right way?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No page will benefit from a simple customer talking about your service just being the best. Instead, your audience is looking for nuance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ask your existing clients for specific ways in which your service has solved their pain points. The more specific, the better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don&#8217;t need a book on your page. But you should look for at least a couple of powerful sentences or a short video.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best testimonials don&#8217;t just reiterate your elevator pitch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, they build on it, taking the high notes and digging in deep. Those specific examples ultimately reinforce your message and build trust throughout your website design.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"538\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Zoom-min-1024x538.jpg\" alt=\"Services Zoom min\" class=\"wp-image-28251\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Zoom-min-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Zoom-min-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Zoom-min-768x403.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Zoom-min-1536x806.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Zoom-min-2048x1075.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Zoom-min-24x13.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Zoom-min-36x19.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Zoom-min-48x25.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption><span style=\"font-size: 14px; text-align: right;\">Source &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/zoom.us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">zoom.us<\/a><\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. The Closing Pitch of Customer Results<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Selling your clients is all about the ROI. Your service should lead to a tangible, positive outcome for anyone who chooses it. Get that message across, and you&#8217;re halfway to the conversion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Showcasing customer results make that outcome real. They help you put real-world numbers into your page design to move away from hypotheticals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can write in-depth case studies that really bring the point home. But those case studies shouldn&#8217;t live on the services page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, use an especially powerful nugget of information to stand out, then link to the case study for those interested. You get the benefit of the big number first, with additional content to dig in deeper.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you collect enough, customer results can be sprinkled throughout your services page to reinforce your benefits. Check out our own <a href=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/services\/shopify-website-design\/\" rel=\" noopener\">Shopify design page<\/a> for an example of that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter5\"><\/a>\n<\/div><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">Chapter 5<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">Creating the Perfect Call To Action &amp; Lead Funnel<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Your opening statement and social proof combine to drive interest and desire.

The conversion opportunity that drives your visitors further down the funnel and into your waiting arms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s what this chapter will focus on.

Build Gated Resources to Gather Contact Information<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To start, consider offering a helpful resource for your audience straight from your services page. In exchange, ask them for nothing but their contact information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that resource helps to solve their pain point, they&#8217;ll be happy to give you their email address.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s the reciprocity principle. If you give your audience something valuable, they&#8217;ll feel compelled to give you something valuable in return.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the service you offer, that resource may be any number of things:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>An industry trends report related to the type of service you offer.<\/li><li>A how-to guide specifically related to the pain point your service solves.<\/li><li>A webinar that includes an expert interview within your target industry.<\/li><li>And much more.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The resource itself shouldn&#8217;t be promotional. Value needs to come first. The promotion comes in what happens after you get the contact information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you have that info, your visitor is no longer anonymous. Instead, you can use their email address to build a lead nurturing sequence specifically designed to sign them up for your service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That sequence can take on a number of forms. Here&#8217;s one example:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A &#8216;thank you&#8217; email immediately after the sign up that provides confirmation gated resource.<\/li><li>An email a week later that reiterates your services page content.<\/li><li>An email a week after that with more specific pricing information<\/li><li>An email a week after that with an invitation to set up a sales call.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"538\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-MB-Creative-min-1-1024x538.jpg\" alt=\"Services MB Creative min 1\" class=\"wp-image-28247\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-MB-Creative-min-1-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-MB-Creative-min-1-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-MB-Creative-min-1-768x403.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-MB-Creative-min-1-1536x806.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-MB-Creative-min-1-2048x1075.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-MB-Creative-min-1-24x13.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-MB-Creative-min-1-36x19.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-MB-Creative-min-1-48x25.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption><span style=\"font-size: 14px; text-align: right;\">Source &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/mbcreative.ca\/web-design\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">mbcreative.ca<\/a><\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Include Cost Calculators for Upsell Opportunities<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you offer a complex pricing model that can&#8217;t be explained in a single sentence? If so, a cost calculator can help your audience understand costs\u2014with a few hidden benefits for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can actually include one of two calculator types on your services page:<br>An understanding of what your service may cost, based on a few basic variables.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An understanding of the value your service may bring based on some numbers from your customer and a few backend ROI numbers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it hits the right mix of simplicity and added value, your visitors will flock to the calculator. Hide the result behind an email form and you once again have a lead generation tool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that&#8217;s not all. Through your calculator, you can also upsell your audience after you show them the results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of it this way: you show the results of the variables your visitors have inputted. But you also show how positively they change with a simple tweak in the variables. That broadens their horizon and gets them to think big.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"538\" src=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Drip-min-1024x538.jpg\" alt=\"Services Drip min\" class=\"wp-image-28244\" srcset=\"https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Drip-min-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Drip-min-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Drip-min-768x403.jpg 768w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Drip-min-1536x806.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Drip-min-2048x1075.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Drip-min-24x13.jpg 24w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Drip-min-36x19.jpg 36w, https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Services-Drip-min-48x25.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption><span style=\"font-size: 14px; text-align: right;\">Source &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.drip.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">drip.co<\/a><\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Drive Your Lead Funnel Through Effective Contact Forms<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Both of the above tactics require a contact form\u2014the mechanism through which your audience actually signs up. Done right, they provide as little friction as possible in getting that visitor email address.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To accomplish that feat, follow a few basic best practices for contact forms:<br>Include only the fields you need. At its most basic, that&#8217;s name and email address.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every field you add decreases the signup chances. Only include info like phone number or client industry if you plan to call or send industry-specific content. <br>Stay below seven fields if at all possible. Beyond that, conversion rates start to drop sharply.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Embed your form in your page when it&#8217;s directly related to the content. A simple contact form for more information can be a separate page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If possible, integrate your CMS and CRM so that new leads automatically enter your customer contact base. That allows you to build automated lead sequences like the above.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter6\"><\/a>\n<\/div><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">Chapter 6<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">How To Optimize Services Pages For SEO<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow the above tips, and you&#8217;ve got a great services page. Now, all you need is to drive traffic to it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s where we turn to an old friend: search engine optimization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The trouble with service page SEO is that the topics are often so broad, you can&#8217;t focus enough for a high ranking on a competitive keyword. That said, you can still make an impact if you get the basics right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Building a Strategy to Match Your Expectations<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Make no mistake: SEO matters. But it&#8217;s also unrealistic to think that you&#8217;ll suddenly become a top result on Google with a few simple tweaks. That&#8217;s important to know as you move into the below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Build a strategy to match those expectations. Instead of trying to rank highly for broad terms within your industry, pull it back with a few basic guidelines:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Focus on a single term that&#8217;s directly related to your service.<\/li><li>Aim for a long-tail keyword that reduces competitiveness.<\/li><li>Look for the low-hanging fruit. What questions would your audience ask that gets them naturally to your service page?<\/li><li>Perform some basic keyword research. Low competitive scores are a great place to start.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Basic Best SEO Practices for Service Pages<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With that strategy in mind, it&#8217;s time to optimize the individual elements of your services page. Start simple, by resizing all images and giving them appropriate alt tags to please Google and increase page speed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond that, you need to make sure your keyword appears naturally but regularly on your page. The title, URL slug, and body copy should all not just mention it, but build value-added content (like an answer to the question) around it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget about your meta description, either. It shows up below your page title in search results, providing a perfect opportunity for some quick but relevant copy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, make sure to include relevant links. When you mention other but related services, for instance, link to those landing pages to keep guiding your audience in the right direction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cross-Linking to Your Services Page for Increased Authority<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of internal links: Make sure that throughout your website, your service page gets the attention it deserves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Search engines like Google consider pages that a lot of other pages are linking to as more authoritative. You can take advantage of that basic fact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From any page on your website design, include links to your services page anytime they&#8217;re relevant. That might be a blog post mentioning the service you provide, or even your homepage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t overdo it, of course. But as long as you keep it to relevant topics, these cross-links can go a long way towards increasing your search profile.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter7\"><\/a>\n<\/div><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">Chapter 7<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">Wrapping Up<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to do yourself a service?
