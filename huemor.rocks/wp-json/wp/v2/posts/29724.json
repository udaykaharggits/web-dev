So is it really a shocker that the same is true for your homepage?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If anything, it&#8217;s even more true. This is your chance to capture your future customers&#8217; attention from the first second. You have to know exactly what they&#8217;re looking for to accomplish that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you understand your audience to build your homepage? Start by identifying your persona&#8217;s PACT.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How to form your PACT<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Forming that PACT (sorry about that pun) includes 4 basic steps:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>1. Find the Pain Points<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>What problem, exactly does your business solve? Or, more specifically, what are the problems that caused your audience to seek you out in the first place?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step in understanding your audience is finding their pain points. There isn&#8217;t a single one, though. Some of them apply to your entire audience, while others focus on only a niche.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To understand what they are, and which is which, you&#8217;ll need to conduct some research.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Learn about your audience&#8217;s needs.<\/li><li>Understand their motivations to act.<\/li><li>Find out their pains, especially those where your company can act as medicine.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h4>2. Identify the Authority<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Any potential customer has to actually have the authority to act on their pain points. That&#8217;s especially true in B2B, where the buying center can include multiple roles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not just the person making the purchase. It might be the person doing some initial research.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, anyone who has an influence on the customer who signs on the dotted line or gives you their credit card number has authority.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s the audience you need to reach. If your homepage can speak to the pain points of those with authority, you&#8217;re winning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>3. Explain the Consequence<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s dig in those pain points a little more. Ask yourself questions like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What happens if your audience wouldn&#8217;t hire your company?<\/li><li>What consequences would they face?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If they believe that life would go on as normal, you might have a problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your homepage needs to communicate the urgency of working with you. That means understanding and being able to explain the consequences of what would happen if your visitors wouldn&#8217;t pull the trigger.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>4. Build the Target Profile<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on all the above, you can build a target profile that helps you understand your audience more completely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of it as a buyer persona specifically for your website. Include the following components:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Your visitors&#8217; pain points<\/li><li>Your visitor&#8217;s authority level<\/li><li>The consequences of not solving pain points<\/li><li>Basic demographic information<\/li><li>At least some psychographics<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>With a profile like that, you don&#8217;t have to worry about missing the mark. Instead, you can develop your entire homepage (from writing to design) with your audience in mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"huemorProtip-container\" style=\"background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><h2 class=\"huemorProtip-title\" style=\"color:black\">Protip<\/h2><p style=\"color:black\" class=\"huemorProtip-description\">This type of research will go well beyond your homepage design.

Now, it&#8217;s time to develop those insights into your homepage setup.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll get into the details of the writing and design below. For now, let&#8217;s focus on the 7 key ingredients that make up a great homepage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Create a memorable first impression<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, you only have 5 seconds. If it looks great, 90% of shoppers will keep looking. If it sucks, 38% never come back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Quickly capture who you are and what you do<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the essence of your business, your value proposition at a quick glance. How simple can you make it for your audience?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Explain how you are better than your competitors<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re probably not the only one solving those pain points. But your audience should know that you&#8217;re better at it than others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Show them you understand their challenges<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>That means directly addressing your audience&#8217;s pain points. Talk to your visitors from their level, not down to them from above.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Build trust<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The right aesthetics build trust and credibility in web design. You can&#8217;t just make bold claims or use bold colors. Everything you say and everything you do has to be believable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>6. Keep them engaged<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you offering any interactive elements, like videos or photo\/story carousels? How can you make sure that what you say doesn&#8217;t just sound good, but prompts your audience to interact with it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>7. Provide a clear next step<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re getting into call to action territory here. The most effective homepages always have a CTA button that drives your audience deeper into your website and content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re building your page and hit these 7 goals, you&#8217;ve already won the first (and probably second) round.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But of course, you have to build them right. Simply cluttering your homepage full of CTA buttons probably won&#8217;t be all that effective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s where we get into the nuances of building a great page. From copywriting to design, you have to get those nuances right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter4\"><\/a>\n<\/div><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">Chapter 4<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">Copywriting Best Practices to Speak to Your Audience<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>You know the components.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You understand your audience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how, exactly, should you write for them?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A picture might be worth 1,000 words, but you still need those words to be great. For your homepage, that means following 4 simple best practices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Make them feel something<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Emotion always hits right. Almost all of our purchasing decisions are, in fact, emotional.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means every word and every sentence you write should be designed to make your audience feel something.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t just explain your product features. Focus on product benefits through real-life examples.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Focus on them, not you<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your About Us page should be about you. Your homepage is all about your audience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wherever you can, replace &#8216;we&#8217; with &#8216;you&#8217; language. Every sentence you write should be directly addressed to your visitors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Get the headline right<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Those 6 to 15 words might just be the most important words on your entire website. It needs to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Include power words that draw attention and drive action.<\/li><li>Minimize clutter and junk &#8211; every word counts.<\/li><li>Include your value proposition in the most basic terms.<\/li><li>Incorporate the keyword you want to rank for most.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Keep it simple<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Less is more, but only if the &#8216;less&#8217; is actually better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Confused?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don&#8217;t have to be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All we&#8217;re saying is that you don&#8217;t need blocks of paragraphs on your homepage. In fact, try to actively stay away from those.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, use simple and clear, sometimes even broken sentences. Try to stay above the fold.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, you can combine your words with effective graphics and images to get your point across.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of which: let&#8217;s move on to design.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter5\"><\/a>\n<\/div><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">Chapter 5<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">Design Best Practices for Your Finishing Touches<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re visual beings. Incorporating visuals in your content pays off big time.<br>If you don&#8217;t get the design of your homepage right, none of the above matters. So here&#8217;s how you get it right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Get the Layout Right<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not just about the content. It&#8217;s where that content shows up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of your visitors read your website in an F-shaped pattern. That means the top matters, and the right-hand side does as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s where you can capitalize.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Place your most powerful visuals and your headline near the top. Make sure that the visual piece carries through the entire page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, you need to place your CTAs in the right spot. Pro-tip: above the fold tends to work well but test it out to get it right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, make sure your layout is responsive. That makes sure the page looks just as great on a 4-inch mobile screen as it would on a 27&#8243; desktop.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Consistency is Key<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you only have a few seconds, your audience won&#8217;t have time to think when they get to your homepage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means they need to find exactly what they expect. The colors and fonts throughout your homepage should match your brand guidelines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t stop there, though.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consistency also matters when it comes to sizing and spacing. The design needs to fit together, rather than being comprised of a bunch of individual, disconnected elements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One way to make that happen: use a grid. Through that grid, you can ensure that every piece lines up with each other and within the overall layout.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Don&#8217;t Be Afraid of Whitespace<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, you should embrace it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whitespace focuses your audience&#8217;s attention. It directs their eyes to the most essential pieces of your homepage. The lack of a design element, in fact, is a crucial design element in itself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not just guesswork. One study found that whitespace can increase reading comprehension by up to 20%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So use it. Find ways to simply highlight your background color. That de-clutters the design and gains your audience&#8217;s trust and attention.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Use (the Right) Pictures<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We already touched on the fact that you need visuals to make your homepage tick. Most likely, those visuals will be images.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you can&#8217;t just download some images from Google and hope for the best. Instead, you need to find the right option:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use your own pictures if you can. That avoids permissions issues and also ties the visuals more closely to your specific brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do have to use stock, be creative. Find ways to make them look more unique to you, and less like something your competitors might work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pictures don&#8217;t have to be photos. If you just can&#8217;t find the right image, use illustrations instead. They can be custom-made and showcase anything you like.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure the pictures fit the space. Like any other element, they need to add to the core message you&#8217;re trying to convey. Anything else is superfluous.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that this is not a linear process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Far from it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your writing, development of CTAs, and layout\/design process can all go hand-in-hand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you do have to get the design part right. The best writing won&#8217;t matter if you can&#8217;t capture your audience&#8217;s attention at first glance through your design choices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ChapterFullwidth\" style=\"background-image:url(https:\/\/huemor.rocks\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper\"><div class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-form\">\n<a id=\"chapter6\"><\/a>\n<\/div><h5 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle\">Chapter 6<\/h5><h2 class=\"ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle\">Wrapping Up<\/h2><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Your homepage, done right, is the coup d&#8217;\u00e9tat of your entire website. It&#8217;s the front door to your business, and you have to make sure it has the right curb appeal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What will it take to get your audience to enter?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to get the design right, and copywriting matters just as much. All depend on a core understanding of your audience, and of course, you need some central elements to make it work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But keep in mind that beyond these best practices, much is subjective.<br>That&#8217;s where it all comes back to your audience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can build a theoretically great website, and watch it fail because your audience didn&#8217;t respond to it. That means you need one final step: testing and improvement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, you can test just about anything on your homepage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That headline? Find out what wording works best.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The image? Check whether that stock photo is really holding you back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whitespace? See if a strategically CTA button might work better in the space.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep working on it. Keep making those improvements. Stay with these best practices, but build on them to create a homepage your audience will love.<br>And, most importantly, never stray too far from answering that central question: why should I hire your company?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over to you.
