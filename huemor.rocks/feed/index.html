<p>We talk a lot about how strategy and planning matter.</p>



<p>But what does that actually look like for B2B’s when they’re trying to expand their inbound lead generation efforts?</p>



<p>In this article, I’ll walk you through how to set up lead generation goals that actually align with business goals.</p>



<p>Goals that are clear, well-defined, and achievable for your business.</p>



<p>Ready to dive in?</p>



<div class="huemorProtip-container" style="background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><h2 class="huemorProtip-title" style="color:black">Disclaimer</h2><p style="color:black" class="huemorProtip-description"> For the purposes of this article, we’ll be using simplified figures and a made-up company to demonstrate how all of this works. For your business, this will likely be more complex, but the approach to solving this should be the same.</p><div class="huemorProtip-button"></div></div>



<h2><strong>The Persona</strong></h2>



<p>AlphaX is an enterprise SaaS company focused on helping businesses improve their supply chain woes. This software, coupled with their onboarding fee averages $30,000 per deal in year one, and 90% of their customers stick around for multiple years.</p>



<p>Over the course of 2021, their company experienced a ton of organic growth due to emerging supply chain challenges during the pandemic. Their top-line revenue soared to $20M annually.</p>



<p>This growth, while increasing revenue, have also increased their overhead.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Defining The Goals</strong></h2>



<h3>Business Goal</h3>



<p>Looking forward to 2022, AlphaX’s CEO has set a revenue growth goal of 20% year-over-year to ensure the company remains healthy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s now up to the marketing team to deliver. Where do they start?</p>



<h3><strong>Sales Goal</strong></h3>



<p>As mentioned above, AlphaX’s CEO has set a goal of 20% YoY growth.</p>



<p>That means their new top-line revenue at the end of 2022 should be $24M annually (a total increase of $4,000,000).</p>



<p>With a retention rate of 90% per year and an average of $30k per new deal, that means AlphaX will need to sign 200 new deals in 2022 to make this goal a reality.</p>



<h3><strong>Marketing Goal</strong></h3>



<p>Knowing the target revenue and deals required to get there, it’s now the marketing team&#8217;s job to figure out what this means in terms of their marketing funnel.</p>



<p>After looking at a collective of both their CRM and Analytics tools, they’ve uncovered the following information.</p>



<ul><li>3% of their visitors fill out a demo form.</li><li>85% of those who fill out a demo form book a demo call.</li><li>90% of those who attend a demo call are interested in a proposal.</li><li>40% of proposals submitted turn into paying customers.</li></ul>



<p>With this information in hand, they’re now equipped to figure out based on historical data what their marketing goals should be.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Understanding The Numbers</strong></h4>



<p>The goal is to acquire 200 new customers, so let’s use that to identify each stage of our funnel.</p>



<p>Let’s start by looking at the close rate. 40% of proposals translate into a new customer. That means AlphaX will need to send out 500 additional proposals in 2022.</p>



<p>Next, let’s look at the interest level after a demo is presented. 90% of people want a proposal, which means 556 additional demos will need to be booked.</p>



<p>Next, let’s look at how many people confirm a demo call after they fill out a form. 85% of people do that, which means 654 additional demo forms need to be submitted.</p>



<p>Lastly, let’s look at how many people fill out a demo form after visiting the website. 3% of people do that, which means 21,800 additional unique people need to visit the website per year.</p>



<p>With that information, we now have additional targets for each stage of our funnel per annum:</p>



<ul><li>Visitors: 21,800</li><li>Demo Form Submits: 654</li><li>Demo Presentations: 556</li><li>Proposals Sent: 500</li></ul>



<p>Monthly, we&#8217;re looking at an extra&#8230;</p>



<ul><li>Visitors: 1,816</li><li>Demo Form Submits: 55</li><li>Demo Presentations: 46</li><li>Proposals Sent: 42 </li></ul>



<p>The 20% goal is starting to get less scary, right? </p>



<div class="huemorProtip-container" style="background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><h2 class="huemorProtip-title" style="color:black">Protip</h2><p style="color:black" class="huemorProtip-description">Oftentimes when running new campaigns, numbers may perform worse than historical recordings. We suggest adding a 10-15% buffer to your goals and then re-evaluating quarterly to continue to fine-tune your goals.</p><div class="huemorProtip-button"></div></div>



<h2><strong>What If I Don’t Have This Data?</strong></h2>



<p>Ideally, in order for this approach to work, a company needs to have good tracking mechanisms in place. This means you have to have both accurate analytics and a CRM that’s kept up to date.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you don’t have those in place within your organization, a low-cost and effective way to set this up would be subscribing to a tool like <a href="https://www.pipedrive.com/">Pipedrive</a> and making sure <a href="https://analytics.google.com/">Google Analytics</a> is installed on your website.</p>



<p>If you don’t have this data, then I’d start with figuring out the following:</p>



<ul><li>Average Deal Value</li><li>Total Increase</li><li>Deal Number</li></ul>



<p>Next, figure out what your close rate is.</p>



<p>From there, you can do some research on what percentages are average for the various stages in your industry. For most B2B’s, we’ve observed the following:</p>



<ul><li>Form Submissions: 1-3%</li><li>Booked Calls: 50-70%</li><li>Proposals: 60-80%</li><li>Close Rate: 20-30%&nbsp;</li></ul>



<div class="huemorProtip-container" style="background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><h2 class="huemorProtip-title" style="color:black">Protip</h2><p style="color:black" class="huemorProtip-description">When starting a lead generation initiative many people are focused on improving their top-of-funnel metrics (visits). In reality, it&#8217;s likely easier to improve your mid-to-bottom funnel metrics (form submissions, booked calls, and close rate) </p><div class="huemorProtip-button">

</div></div>



<h2><strong>Wrapping Up</strong></h2>



<p>By following the steps above the marketing team was able to demystify their objectives and break things down into concrete numbers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This provides them with a clear understanding of what needs to be accomplished, and will now allow them to ideate on how to make those numbers a reality.</p>



<p>If you skip this step and jump immediately into tactics, you’re setting yourself up for failure.</p>



<h3><strong>Math Cheat Sheet</strong></h3>



<ul><li>Total Increase = (Annual Revenue x % Increase)</li><li>Deal Number = ((Annual Revenue x % Retention Rate) + (Total Increase) / (Average Deal Value))</li><li>Proposals Sent = (Deal Number / % Close Rate)</li><li>Presentations = (Proposals Sent / % Interested In Proposal)</li><li>Form Submissions = (Presentations / % Presentations Booked)</li><li>Visitors = (Form Submissions / % Form Conversion Rate)</li><li>Average Deal Value = (Total Sales / Total Number of Sales)</li><li>Close Rate = (Number of Deals Won / Number of Proposals Sent)</li></ul>

<p>This website is a great example of what B2B SaaS websites should be like in 2022. Although the content is communicated effectively, the dynamic visuals are the most captivating element of this website. The street animations for each section add a unique touch that captures the reader’s attention, and it makes navigation fun and interactive. This kind of creativity and attention to detail is exactly what websites need to become memorable among readers.</p>

<p>Cause-based websites exist to secure the reader’s attention and invite them to support their cause. This website<a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/about-us-page-design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> conveys what it’s about</a> in a unique and enjoyable way with a compelling story and the site immerses users. Readers are immersed in an aesthetically pleasing experience that showcases the impacts of climate change on the ocean. The informative voiceover, the stunning visuals, and the background music all work hand-in-hand to create a sad but beautiful story. The content is structured more like a video game than a website, which is what makes it so appealing to its audience and is an example of great website design ideas!</p>

<p>This is a top example of how e-commerce has evolved throughout the years. Websites have taken a bold leap from sleek and concise platforms to detailed and interactive landing pages. This type of design is becoming the norm for a good reason. The pop of color on the website is vibrant but easy on the eyes, effectively highlighting each product. The animations for the drinks gives them a creative blend of having a look that&#8217;s both creative and realistic at the same time, practically inviting the audience to reach over and grab the drinks themselves.</p>

<p>The website is an ideal match for their brand with a cohesive theme. The layout is consistent throughout all the pages, giving a very neat and minimal vibe. The<a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/top-homepage-design-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> homepage</a> is the first thing users see in a website, so putting their new products there directly is a good move as well since it encourages viewers to purchase their products. Although the site seems simple at first glance, the technology page adds an interactive touch and the eye-catching animations make the page more interesting and appealing.</p>

<p>Blending shapes together to create images seems to be an emerging trend among websites lately. It can only be seen once on this website but it is used effectively nonetheless. The way new information pops out as you scroll through the homepage is satisfying, despite being a simple feature. The hamburger navigation is useful and clean; you can easily find what you need and does encourage visitors to visit each landing page.</p>



<h2>6. <a href="https://elementaryml.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><a href="https://elementaryml.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Elementary</strong></a></h2>

<p>Many websites opt to use loud colors to match their brand, but the muted aesthetic of this website design complements its products perfectly. The color scheme is strategically planned out, making the website look clean and classy.&nbsp; It integrates a splash of color in some areas as needed, but the solid colors and simple backgrounds divert the audience’s attention towards the products.

The rendering, lighting, and models aren’t too complex but they produced an enjoyable outcome nonetheless.

<p>Horizontal Scroll has been on the rise recently. This is our first time seeing a website use horizontal scroll throughout all of its pages. It was a bold move but it turned out well. It was executed beautifully across the website, filled with subtle moving animations. We enjoyed this website so much that it actually inspired us to create our own take on it! We have decided to use this as our main inspiration for our HITT project this year.</p>

<p>From the moment you open the website, you’ll see that its structure bears resemblance to the way Apple introduces its new products. This style is becoming increasingly popular among different brands and companies. It’s good that this website executed the trend in a way that makes it its own. The animations make it feel like you’re watching a video rather than scrolling through a page. Each scroll up and down feels like you’re hitting rewind or fast forward. It suits their brand’s theme well.</p>

<p>They assume that if someone is interested enough in the offer they&#8217;ll fill out anything. That is simply not true.</p>



<p>Just think about it — how many times have you abandoned a bad contact form experience? Most likely too many to count.</p>



<p>Contact forms that&#8230;</p>



<ul><li>Ask too many questions</li><li>Don&#8217;t make it obvious what&#8217;s required</li><li>Don&#8217;t make it obvious when you&#8217;ve completed something</li></ul>



<p>These poor decisions with contact forms hurt your business more than you&#8217;re probably even aware of.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re a marketer tasked with improving lead quality or volume for your business, improving your contact forms should be your first main objective.</p>



<p><meta charset="utf-8">Even small changes can have a huge impact on both the volume of inquiries you’ll receive and the quality of those opportunities.</p>



<p>In this article, we’ll be sharing research-backed conversion tips on how to improve your contact forms. We&#8217;ll also discuss more advanced ideas that B2B businesses can take advantage of to reduce the need for certain fields while still getting all the information you need from a prospect.</p>



<p>Ready to take your contact forms to the next level? Let&#8217;s dive in.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>10 UX Best Practices for Forms</strong></h2>



<p>Before we dive into the more advanced conversion tips, let’s cover some general contact form best practices from a user experience perspective. These tips are easy to understand and implement and are an effective way to<a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/how-to-improve-your-website" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> improve your website without a full redesign</a>.</p>



<h3><strong>Keep Your Forms Short</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="633" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Keep-Your-Forms-Short@2x-1024x633.jpg" alt="Keep Your Forms Short@2x" class="wp-image-30699" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Keep-Your-Forms-Short@2x-1024x633.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Keep-Your-Forms-Short@2x-300x185.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Keep-Your-Forms-Short@2x-768x475.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Keep-Your-Forms-Short@2x-1536x950.jpg 1536w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Keep-Your-Forms-Short@2x-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Keep-Your-Forms-Short@2x-36x22.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Keep-Your-Forms-Short@2x-48x30.jpg 48w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Keep-Your-Forms-Short@2x.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Attention spans around the world are<a href="https://psychminds.com/is-the-internet-destroying-our-attentions-span/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> decreasing with every passing year</a>, so the pressure is on your contact form to keep them engaged. The most straightforward way to accomplish this is to keep your form structure short.</p>



<p>By limiting the number of fields the user has to fill out upfront, the likelihood of form completion goes up by as much as 50%, as verified by a study from<a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/6746/Which-Types-of-Form-Fields-Lower-Landing-Page-Conversions.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Hubspot</a> that tested the effect of reducing the number of fields from 4 to 3. In addition,<a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/contact-form-conversion-rate/?display=wide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Quickspot</a> found that the conversion rate with only 3 fields was 25%, compared to 20% for 3-5 fields and 16% for 6+ fields. Keep in mind, however, that indiscriminately deleting fields might<a href="https://www.ventureharbour.com/how-form-length-impacts-conversion-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> hurt your conversion rate</a> instead — you need to know what fields your users want to fill out.</p>



<h3><strong>Make Sure Fields Are Consistently Sized</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="633" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Make-Sure-Fields-Are-Consistently-Sized@2x-1024x633.jpg" alt="Make Sure Fields Are Consistently Sized@2x" class="wp-image-30702" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Make-Sure-Fields-Are-Consistently-Sized@2x-1024x633.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Make-Sure-Fields-Are-Consistently-Sized@2x-300x185.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Make-Sure-Fields-Are-Consistently-Sized@2x-768x475.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Make-Sure-Fields-Are-Consistently-Sized@2x-1536x950.jpg 1536w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Make-Sure-Fields-Are-Consistently-Sized@2x-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Make-Sure-Fields-Are-Consistently-Sized@2x-36x22.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Make-Sure-Fields-Are-Consistently-Sized@2x-48x30.jpg 48w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Make-Sure-Fields-Are-Consistently-Sized@2x.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Our eyes follow the motion of our reading, so if your fields are inconsistently sized or unnecessarily long, it makes the experience of filling out your form less user-friendly. </p>



<p>Making sure your form fields are presented with a consistent size is part of form best practices. This improves the rhythm in which the user can easily read, understand, and progress through your forms.</p>



<p>Your site visitors and potential customers are not super likely to complete any long forms and will decrease your average conversion rate. Having optional fields can help lessen the intensity of a form&#8217;s appearance.</p>



<h3><strong>Users Can Tab Through Fields</strong></h3>



<p>Being able to easily tab through contact form fields in their intended order is incredibly helpful for your desktop users. This improves the speed at which they can complete your form. </p>



<p>This way potential customers and qualified leads can lead the conversation to only what fits for them and they want to get out of filling out your form. This can make things quicker for users do not have to fill out unnecessary form fields and shorten the overall form.</p>



<h3><strong>Keep Labels Visible</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="633" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Use-Placeholder-Text-Effectively-1.png" alt="Use Placeholder Text Effectively 1" class="wp-image-30684" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Use-Placeholder-Text-Effectively-1.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Use-Placeholder-Text-Effectively-1-300x185.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Use-Placeholder-Text-Effectively-1-768x475.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Use-Placeholder-Text-Effectively-1-24x15.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Use-Placeholder-Text-Effectively-1-36x22.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Use-Placeholder-Text-Effectively-1-48x30.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>If you’re trying to project a sleek, minimalist image on your business website, you may be tempted to remove labels in favor of just keeping placeholder text for form fields. Don’t do this — it hurts the user experience when they forget what field they’re filling out. It adds friction to the process when they have to erase their answers to verify they’re filling out the right field. </p>



<p>According to this<a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2557265" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> study from Google</a>, the most usable web forms have field labels above the corresponding input fields for quick reference.</p>



<h3><strong>Use Placeholder Text Effectively</strong></h3>



<p>Instead of using the placeholder text to repeat the label name, you should instead use it to present ideal formatting clues. This will ensure that the data entered in the fields better matches your ideal, making it easier for you to sort the information you’ve gathered. </p>



<p>This is especially relevant for fields that deal with information that can be formatted in many different ways, such as dates. Do you want them to enter January 3, 2022, 01/03/22, 03/01/2022, or 01-03-2022? Alternatively, you can also utilize dropdown menus to lessen confusion over formatting.</p>



<h3><strong>Have Clear Active States</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="633" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Clear-Active-State@2x-1024x633.jpg" alt="Clear Active State@2x" class="wp-image-30733" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Clear-Active-State@2x-1024x633.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Clear-Active-State@2x-300x185.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Clear-Active-State@2x-768x475.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Clear-Active-State@2x-1536x950.jpg 1536w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Clear-Active-State@2x-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Clear-Active-State@2x-36x22.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Clear-Active-State@2x-48x30.jpg 48w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Clear-Active-State@2x.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>When your user is actively editing a form field, make sure there are clear visual cues for them to know what they’re editing. You can accomplish this by highlighting the current field in a different color, making the lines more prominent, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Have Clear Error States</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="633" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Have-Clear-Error-States.png" alt="Have Clear Error States" class="wp-image-30680" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Have-Clear-Error-States.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Have-Clear-Error-States-300x185.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Have-Clear-Error-States-768x475.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Have-Clear-Error-States-24x15.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Have-Clear-Error-States-36x22.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Have-Clear-Error-States-48x30.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>If your user makes a mistake while filling out the form, make sure they know right away and it’s<a href="https://www.zuko.io/blog/a-guide-to-error-messages-in-online-forms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> clear what the error is</a>. </p>



<p>For example, if you are asking for their email address and they messed up the domain name, your error message can say “Please use standard domain format, e.g. johndoe@example.com” rather than “Invalid email address.” </p>



<p>Users tend to get frustrated from unclear error messages so by creating a clear and direct error message this will lessen the headache for you and your customers.</p>



<h3><strong>The Button Must Stand Out</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="633" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-Button-Must-Stand-Out.png" alt="The Button Must Stand Out" class="wp-image-30681" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-Button-Must-Stand-Out.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-Button-Must-Stand-Out-300x185.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-Button-Must-Stand-Out-768x475.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-Button-Must-Stand-Out-24x15.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-Button-Must-Stand-Out-36x22.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-Button-Must-Stand-Out-48x30.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>If the dominant color on your webpage is green, what should the color of your “submit” button be? If you think it should be green to match the rest of the page, then stop right there. </p>



<p>The best color for a call to action button, as reviewed by<a href="https://optinmonster.com/which-color-button-converts-best/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> OptinMonster</a>, is one that stands out from the rest of the page. In our previous example, the best color would be red, as it’s the complementary color on the opposite side of the color wheel. This helps draw attention and make the button obvious and visible to your users. </p>



<p>You should also ensure that the button has clear states for hover and click for even more visibility.</p>



<p>An additional tip for increasing the effectiveness of your call to action button is adding a<a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/how-to-use-testimonials/s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> testimonial</a> within the page. A good testimonial might just be the final push for someone to make that click as social proof can boost the number of sign ups your form gets (and your sales team will thank you later!)</p>



<h3><strong>Optimize Your Fields for Mobile</strong></h3>



<p>In 2020,<a href="https://www.perficient.com/insights/research-hub/mobile-vs-desktop-usage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> 68% of global website visits came from mobile</a> instead of desktop. This means that when you want to make a<a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/top-b2b-website-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> truly great B2B website</a>, you need to make sure it looks good on a mobile device. </p>



<p>Make sure your contact forms are optimized and you’re taking advantage of the right mobile keyboard functions per field and a user can easily cycle through the fields on their device. Since to make your short form mobile friendly you have to find of how mobile responsive your form is, due to this you might need to create a mobile version of your form that allows mobile users the ease of use when they are answering your form. </p>



<p>This may end up differing from the desktop version of your web form.</p>



<h3><strong>Make Sure There’s a Clear Confirmation</strong></h3>



<p>It’s frustrating when you click submit on a contact form and the website doesn’t tell you whether or not it worked. Should you wait and see if it gives you any confirmation? Should you fill it in again?</p>



<p>When your user completes the form, it should be obvious to them. An entirely separate “thank you” page is the most preferable option as well as one of the form design best practices for form completion.</p>



<h2><strong>What Form Fields You Actually Need</strong></h2>



<p>Now that we’re done with the general conversion tips, you might be thinking “Everyone says ‘make your form shorter,’ but what fields do I actually need to keep?” Let’s start with what people don’t like filling out:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="633" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/What-Form-Fields-You-Actually-Need@2x-1024x633.jpg" alt="What Form Fields You Actually Need@2x" class="wp-image-30704" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/What-Form-Fields-You-Actually-Need@2x-1024x633.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/What-Form-Fields-You-Actually-Need@2x-300x185.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/What-Form-Fields-You-Actually-Need@2x-768x475.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/What-Form-Fields-You-Actually-Need@2x-1536x950.jpg 1536w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/What-Form-Fields-You-Actually-Need@2x-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/What-Form-Fields-You-Actually-Need@2x-36x22.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/What-Form-Fields-You-Actually-Need@2x-48x30.jpg 48w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/What-Form-Fields-You-Actually-Need@2x.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In the era of data privacy concerns, people are more and more hesitant to give out information like phone numbers and address information. Even if you leave a note that says “We value your privacy. Your information is safe and will never be shared,” the person filling out your form has to take that promise at face value because you haven’t earned their trust yet. </p>



<p>If your contact form is currently asking for personal data, you’re likely putting yourself at a disadvantage. Asking for this information runs the risk of scaring off your users but it remains a<a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/biggest-website-redesign-mistakes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> common website mistake</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In reality, most B2B contact forms only need the following information:</p>



<ul><li>Name</li><li>Email Address</li></ul>



<p>Seriously, that’s it.</p>



<p>If that doesn’t feel like enough information, let’s talk about how you can gain more while still keeping your form as short as possible.</p>



<h2><strong>How To Improve Lead Quality</strong></h2>



<p>So, you now have a name and an email address. That’s plenty of information to start with — provided you use the correct tools.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Use Email Automation To Further Qualify</strong></h3>



<p>Getting people to fill in your contact form is the initial goal, but your overall goal is to nurture your leads and eventually convince them to buy your product or service. The first step to getting more information out of an email address is setting up email automation. </p>



<p>By using email automation to follow up on form submissions, you immediately accomplish two things: you ensure that the email address they submitted is valid and you begin the sales process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A crucial component to the latter objective is sending a personalized email instead of a dry general email. This immediately starts building trust and start to increase conversions. You can even use it to ask 3-5 additional questions you may need to know to qualify the prospect. </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s an example of an e-mail we automatically send after someone fills out a form:</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<div class="wp-container-6247422752b87 wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<div class="wp-container-62474227527da wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<p><em>Hi First_Name,</em></p>



<p><em>To make sure we understand what you&#8217;re looking for, please share some information about your project:</em></p>



<ul><li><em>Are you looking for a single project or ongoing work? Or both?</em></li><li><em>What are the biggest challenges/obstacles with your current website?</em></li><li><em>What&#8217;s the project timeline/level of urgency?</em></li><li><em>How much are you looking to invest in this project/engagement?</em></li></ul>



<p>I<em>f you’ve already prepared some useful information, such as an RFP or scope of work, please feel free to attach it to your reply, we’d love to see it.</em></p>



<p><em>Looking forward to your response!</em></p>



<p><em>Cheers!</em></p>



<p><em>Jack Morrin</em></p>



<p><em>Sales Assistant</em></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>This simple touchpoint allows us to quickly create an additional touchpoint with the prospect and ask a few additional qualifying questions that are super important for our sales team. </p>

<h3><strong>Use 3rd Party Tools To Augment Data</strong></h3>



<p>You can use an email address for more than just sending emails — it’s 2022, technology is available to help you get data on prospects even if they didn’t personally submit that data to you. You can integrate a tool like<a href="https://clearbit.com/"> ClearBit</a> with your CRM to automatically pull information based on an email address, such as insights like their full name, job title, and company demographic information.</p>

<h2><strong>Why &amp; When To Use Multi-Step Forms</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="633" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mult-step-Form-Example@2x-1024x633.jpg" alt="Mult step Form Example@2x" class="wp-image-30735" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mult-step-Form-Example@2x-1024x633.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mult-step-Form-Example@2x-300x185.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mult-step-Form-Example@2x-768x475.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mult-step-Form-Example@2x-1536x950.jpg 1536w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mult-step-Form-Example@2x-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mult-step-Form-Example@2x-36x22.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mult-step-Form-Example@2x-48x30.jpg 48w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mult-step-Form-Example@2x.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>So, as we’ve previously established, you should be keeping your contact forms as short as possible and to roughly one page. However, what if you absolutely need that data? Applying contact form best practices to a form that requires more than 10 entries requires the use of multi-step forms with multiple fields.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After being told that you only truly need a name and an email address on the contact form, you might be confused as to why you would ever need a form long enough that it requires multiple steps. The reasoning is simple — it depends heavily on the purpose of your contact form.</p>



<p>Imagine that you’re shopping around for an estimate on the value of your house. You see a real estate agency that promises a free online estimate, but the only thing their form asks is a name and an email address. What insight could they possibly offer you with only that information?</p>



<p>Multi-step forms are amazing solutions for longer forms, such as an application or registration form. They’re also a good way to get more information from your leads — starting with “low-friction” or “low-threat” (e.g. what service are you looking for?) fields. </p>



<p>These can engage them and allow you to ask more sensitive questions near the end when it’s less likely for them to back out because they’ve already invested time and effort. Multi-step forms that include a progress bar are also effective at getting users to complete forms, due to the “<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/500480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">endowed progress effect</a>.”</p>



<p>When making a multi-step form, the same conversion tips apply. You should keep each batch of fields short so you don’t overwhelm the user. </p>



<p>A case study from<a href="http://ventureharbour.com/multi-step-lead-forms-get-300-conversions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Venture Harbour</a> saw a 53% increase in conversion rate when they formatted 30+ questions in a four-step form. Data from<a href="https://www.formstack.com/resources/report-form-conversion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Formstack</a> backs this up — multi-step forms have a completion rate of 13.85%, compared to 4.53% on a single long form.</p>



<h2><strong>Why &amp; When To Use Embedded Forms</strong></h2>



<p>Many businesses keep separate<a href="https://huemor.rocks/blog/service-page-design-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> service pages</a> and contact form pages. However, forms that are directly embedded in landing pages tend to outperform CTAs to open a separate contact form page. The reasoning is, as always, convenience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whenever you can, you should try and incorporate a contact form directly on key landing pages, ideally above the fold of the page and again at the bottom of the landing page. It should also stand out from the rest of the web page elements so your user can find it easily.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re following the previously highlighted conversion tips (i.e. keeping forms concise), then this should be relatively easy to accomplish from a design perspective.</p>



<h2><strong>How To Keep Forms Secure (Without Hurting Conversions)</strong></h2>



<p>On paper, Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart or CAPTCHAs are a great way to reduce spam and ensure you’re getting quality information from your form, but did you know that visible CAPTCHAs actually hurt conversion rates?&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="633" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x-1024x633.jpg" alt="How To Keep Forms Secure@2x" class="wp-image-30706" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x-1024x633.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x-300x185.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x-768x475.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x-1536x950.jpg 1536w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x-36x22.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x-48x30.jpg 48w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-To-Keep-Forms-Secure@2x.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>According to this case study from<a href="https://moz.com/blog/captchas-affect-on-conversion-rates"> Moz</a>, having CAPTCHA on reduced the amount of spam conversions by 4.1% but companies could actually lose out on 3.2% of genuine conversions. This is likely because CAPTCHA has become too difficult and confusing, in an effort to combat the increasing sophistication of spambots. </p>



<p>It simply isn’t user-friendly — who wants to take the time to puzzle over a distorted set of letters or numbers and painstakingly type them out?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead of using CAPTCHA, you can look to alternatives that are convenient or invisible to the front-end user but still keep spam and brute force attacks at bay. One such example is Google’s<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/12/3/7325925/google-is-killing-captcha-as-we-know-it" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> reCAPTCHA</a>, which can be as simple as clicking a checkbox.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Tracking Performance &amp; Making Improvements</strong></h2>



<p>Whenever you make any type of changes to your contact forms, it is downright impossible to truly understand their impact without tracking performance. Here are three key tests and methods you should be using to track improvements:</p>



<h3><strong>Set Up Goals</strong></h3>



<p>Using<a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Google Analytics</a> (or your preferred analytics tool), make sure each form on your website has a unique goal attached to it for completion. This will give you a better understanding of the success rate of filling out these forms.</p>



<h3><strong>Use Behavior Tracking</strong></h3>



<p>Using tools like<a href="https://www.hotjar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Hotjar</a> or<a href="https://www.luckyorange.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> LuckyOrange</a> will provide you with a better understanding of how people are interacting with your contact forms in real-time. This could help you identify drop-off points or even bugs within the forms themselves.</p>



<h3><strong>Split Test</strong></h3>



<p>Tools like<a href="https://www.optimizely.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Optimizely</a>,<a href="https://vwo.com/platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> VWO</a>, and<a href="https://www.convert.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Convert</a> allow you to easily and effectively set up split tests. In these scenarios, you can run variations of form configurations side by side and understand how they truly are performing. </p>



<p>Split tests can help you pinpoint which elements of your contact forms help or harm your conversion rate. The more tests you perform, the better optimized your form will be by the end.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Wrapping Up</strong></h2>



<p>That finishes our rundown of contact form best practices. Contact forms are one of the biggest opportunities for businesses to improve both the quality and quantity of leads, so make sure you never neglect to optimize them. Always keep these three conversion tips in mind:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Keep them as concise as possible.</li><li>Use other methods to get the additional info you need.</li><li>Test and monitor all of your improvements to maximize your results.</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Can you imagine how many websites consumers visit per year? By the time potential clients get to your site, they’ve likely seen hundreds of others. For this reason, these individuals already have a vague idea about design standards — exactly what to expect from a brand’s page in terms of appearance, design elements, web accessibility, and functionality.</p>



<span id="more-29668"></span>



<p>Because of their previous viewing experiences, their instincts tell them where to find logos, <a href="/blog/website-navigation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">navigation tools</a>, and scroll bars. These predispositions require brands to adhere to specific norms to elevate the user experience (UX) and user expectations.</p>



<p>With the help of our experienced web designers and design team, we made a list of design standards we follow to create standout websites for our clients. Read on to discover which ones you can apply to propel your business to new heights.</p>



<h2>What Are Web Design Standards?</h2>



<p>Web design standards are guidelines that cover the look and behind-the-scenes performance of sites. Sticking to such specifications allows you to offer clear and consistent messaging across all pages. Most recommendations relate to aesthetics, but not all of them do.</p>



<p>From the users’ point of view, such standards ensure predictable experiences that make navigation intuitive. Other benefits of using these suggestions include:</p>



<ul><li>Achieving good first impressions</li><li>Improving Google rankings</li><li>Minimizing bounce rates</li></ul>



<p>These benefits ultimately lead to a boost in leads, conversions, and revenue.</p>



<p>Remember that not all standards adhere to best design practices; they are two different things. However, we will only tackle factors that won’t harm your UX or Google rankings.</p>



<p>Are you ready to take your website to the next level? Let’s get right to it.</p>



<h2>1. Visually Consistent and Pleasing</h2>



<p>The latest <a href="https://www.sweor.com/firstimpressions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web design statistics</a> reveal that it only takes a whopping 0.05 seconds for visitors to decide whether they’ll stay or leave your site.</p>



<p>As much as people love saying, “Don’t judge a book by its cover,” they determine a brand’s credibility rather quickly. So, which factor affects these snap judgments the most? You guessed it: design! Consumers should take one look at your site and easily find what they need.</p>



<p>For example, check out <a href="https://arngren.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ARNGREN’s website</a>. It’s a Norwegian electronic company using a classified ads-type design. With a layout like this one, it’s hard to find products and navigate between pages.</p>



<p>Now, look at <a href="https://lusetabeauty.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luseta Beauty’s site</a>. We created this web page for a brand of affordable all-natural, salon-quality hair care products. The layout allows maximum visibility and movability, making scrolling fun and easy. (Check out our <a href="https://huemor.rocks/case-studies/luseta-beauty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">case study</a> to learn more about the design process of Luseta Beauty&#8217;s new website!)</p>



<p>As you can see, aesthetics matter. No matter how exceptional your products or services are, no one will believe you if your website doesn’t communicate your strengths to your end users.</p>



<p>Here are some pro tips to impose your online authority:</p>



<h3>Stay mobile-friendly:</h3>



<p>We all know mobile phones are super common, did you know that <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/2479/mobile-search/#dossierKeyfigures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mobile phone search users</a> in the U.S. have reached 200 million! If you don’t design for mobile devices, you miss countless opportunities to capture this population via search engines.</p>



<div class="huemorProtip-container" style="background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><h2 class="huemorProtip-title" style="color:black">Protip</h2><p style="color:black" class="huemorProtip-description">Consider various web browsers such as Google Chrome or Safari, test your website&#8217;s <a href="https://www.lambdatest.com/feature" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cross browser compatibility</a>!</p><div class="huemorProtip-button"></div></div>



<h3>Observe consistency:</h3>



<p>Use a holistic approach when building or revamping your website. Think of it as a whole instead of broken sections.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="666" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Visually-Consistent-and-Pleasing.png" alt="Visually Consistent and Pleasing" class="wp-image-29987" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Visually-Consistent-and-Pleasing.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Visually-Consistent-and-Pleasing-300x195.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Visually-Consistent-and-Pleasing-768x500.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Visually-Consistent-and-Pleasing-24x16.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Visually-Consistent-and-Pleasing-36x23.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Visually-Consistent-and-Pleasing-48x31.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3>Avoid too much clutter:</h3>



<p>While the ARNGREN example is a bit extreme, a minimalist website is the way to go. Check out these <a href="/blog/top-retail-website-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top retail websites</a> for inspiration.</p>



<h2>2. Intuitive Navigation</h2>



<p><a href="https://smallbiztrends.com/2019/01/easy-website-navigation-is-important.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A 2019 consumer research</a> shares jaw-dropping results — 94% of site visitors demand easily navigable websites from organizations. The modern consumer simply doesn’t have the patience to stay for non-standard placements, generic labels, and too many subcategories.</p>



<p>Apart from looking nice, websites should provide users with an intuitive flow that guides them every step of the way. If consumers have to find their way around your site, there’s something wrong with it. Below are web design standards and best practices most brands observe.</p>



<h3>Place the main navigation options in the header:</h3>



<p>Most websites do this, so consumers instinctively look at the top portion of your homepage to check your site’s contents. One great example includes the top left corner housing your company&#8217;s logo as this will help to increase user experience.</p>



<h3>Consider using a dropdown menu:</h3>



<p>This increases functionality as the visual hierarchy saves precious webpage space and makes the navigation process less overwhelming. However, make sure to use clear, concise labels. For example, using terms like products and solutions separately might confuse site visitors.</p>



<h3>If dropdown menus aren’t for you, try hamburger menus:</h3>



<p>Also called hamburger buttons, these tools are the three horizontal lines web pages use to offer more navigation options. Brands like Facebook, CNN, and MyFitnessPal use them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="378" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Intuitive-Navigation.png" alt="Intuitive Navigation" class="wp-image-29988" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Intuitive-Navigation.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Intuitive-Navigation-300x111.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Intuitive-Navigation-768x284.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Intuitive-Navigation-24x9.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Intuitive-Navigation-36x13.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Intuitive-Navigation-48x18.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>3. Visual Direction</h2>



<p>Visual direction separates good designers from great ones. It means controlling the eye movement of a visitor to encourage desired actions. You can achieve this by leaving visual cues without compromising your web page’s aesthetics. Check out these visual direction best practices:</p>



<h3>Use images to control movement:</h3>



<p>You can guide consumers toward the content you want them to see through proper picture placement. For example, you can use pictures of real people pointing at a product. Don’t use photos just to fill spaces; instead, use them with purpose.</p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/James-square.jpg" alt="James square" class="wp-image-29377" width="125" height="125" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/James-square.jpg 500w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/James-square-300x300.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/James-square-150x150.jpg 150w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/James-square-24x24.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/James-square-36x36.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/James-square-48x48.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 125px) 100vw, 125px" /></figure></div>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-black-color has-text-color">&#8220;All designs, good or bad, start with fonts, colors, and images. The differences are the decisions we make to balance the beauty and the purpose.&#8221;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center" style="font-size:14px">&#8211; James Utkovic, Creative Director</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
</div>
</div>



<h3>Lead the eye:</h3>



<p>Face pareidolia is the phenomenon wherein individuals naturally detect other people’s faces. Even when these faces are pictures on a website, visitors will follow their line of sight. For this reason, it’s essential to have models looking toward valuable information and never away from the page.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="706" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Visual-Direction.png" alt="Visual Direction" class="wp-image-29989" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Visual-Direction.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Visual-Direction-300x207.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Visual-Direction-768x530.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Visual-Direction-24x17.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Visual-Direction-36x25.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Visual-Direction-48x33.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3>Illustrate concepts with images:</h3>



<p>If you’re in the beauty industry and your unique selling proposition is that you have a three-in-one eye shadow-blush-lipstick product, it’s better to use photos than use 300 words to explain the idea. These <a href="/blog/top-beauty-website-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">standout beauty websites </a>will show you how to do it right.</p>



<h2>4. Social Proof</h2>



<p>Social proof is the process of using the actions and attitudes of other people to affect another’s behavior. Do you ever wonder why <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/word-of-mouth-marketing/#what-is-word-of-mouth-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">word of mouth marketing</a> impacts the purchasing decisions of 92% of consumers? It’s because there’s no higher form of social proof than recommendations from relatives and friends.</p>



<p>When building or upgrading the social proof portion of your site, remember that B2B and B2C web pages work differently. Here are essential factors to remember:</p>



<p>For B2B websites, <a href="/blog/how-to-use-testimonials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using testimonials</a> would be ideal. You can also use client logos, industry awards, and reviews from sites like G2 or Yelp. Check out these <a href="/blog/top-b2b-website-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">groundbreaking B2B websites</a> for inspiration.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="582" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Social-Proof.png" alt="Social Proof" class="wp-image-29990" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Social-Proof.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Social-Proof-300x171.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Social-Proof-768x437.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Social-Proof-24x14.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Social-Proof-36x20.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Social-Proof-48x27.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>On the other hand, product reviews, customer testimonials, and media features work best for B2C websites.</p>



<p>Focus on return on investment (ROI) for B2B sites and pain points for B2C ones.</p>



<h2>5. ADA Compliance</h2>



<p>Today, there are 61 million <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/infographic-disability-impacts-all.html#:~:text=61%20million%20adults%20in%20the,is%20highest%20in%20the%20South.." target="_blank" rel="noopener">disabled American adults</a>. Most of them have mobility, cognitive, hearing, and vision disabilities that make it challenging to gain information. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires websites to follow various design standards to address these individuals’ needs.</p>



<p>An <a href="/blog/our-secret-to-ada-site-compliance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADA-compliant website</a> ensures all users can access and navigate your site comfortably without discriminating anyone from using it for its intended purpose.</p>



<p>ADA broke down its website requirements into four categories. Web pages should be perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="378" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ADA-Compliance.png" alt="ADA Compliance" class="wp-image-29991" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ADA-Compliance.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ADA-Compliance-300x111.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ADA-Compliance-768x284.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ADA-Compliance-24x9.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ADA-Compliance-36x13.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ADA-Compliance-48x18.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3>Perceivable:</h3>



<p>Brands should provide all users with information that they can distinguish and understand. Creators should develop content that consumers can easily see or hear regardless of disability. For instance, you should find alternative options for CAPTCHA.</p>



<h3>Operable:</h3>



<p>Organizations should make their websites navigable for people with disabilities. They shouldn’t experience limited functionalities or unreasonable time limits. If disabled people buy things online, they should have enough time to input their card details and one-time validation PIN code.</p>



<h3>Understandable:</h3>



<p>Websites should avoid consumer error at all costs by explaining processes thoroughly and confirming financial information before submitting an order.</p>



<h3>Robust:</h3>



<p>Content should be robust enough for all users to interpret. For example, your site should allow visitors to determine the name of a user interface form.</p>



<h2>6. Short Contact Forms</h2>



<p>You might already have the aesthetics, navigation, social proof, and ADA compliance down. Don’t let long contact forms scare potential clients away. As much as possible, limit your questions to six and below.</p>



<p>Short contact forms on various landing pages convert more visitors. For this reason, we highly recommend removing anything unnecessary from these lead generation tools.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="822" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Short-Contact-Forms.png" alt="Short Contact Forms" class="wp-image-29992" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Short-Contact-Forms.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Short-Contact-Forms-300x241.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Short-Contact-Forms-768x617.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Short-Contact-Forms-24x19.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Short-Contact-Forms-36x29.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Short-Contact-Forms-48x39.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>7. Focused Call to Action</h2>



<p>A powerful call to action (CTA) can help build social following, customer databases, and close sales. It all depends on what you ask your clients to do. For best results, focus on a single CTA instead of providing options for desired actions.</p>



<p>If you want potential clients to try your product for free, say it. Having them choose between learning about your offer, signing up for your mailing list, or buying your product or service can be quite daunting. Multiple actions can end up turning prospects away.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="660" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Focused-Call-to-Action.png" alt="Focused Call to Action" class="wp-image-29993" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Focused-Call-to-Action.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Focused-Call-to-Action-300x193.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Focused-Call-to-Action-768x495.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Focused-Call-to-Action-24x15.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Focused-Call-to-Action-36x23.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Focused-Call-to-Action-48x31.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The homepage is the first thing people see when they visit a website, so it’s important to make a good first impression with your homepage content. Your homepage content will compel visitors who are interested in your services or products then convert them into leads and ultimately customers. It also helps you establish your authority in your niche.</p>



<span id="more-29670"></span>



<p>It’s important to learn that what your homepage offers is your most valuable asset, but it can be a nerve-wracking task to build one, especially when you don’t know where to start. The trick is to spend time on the important elements that provide people clarity on what you have to offer and how they can benefit from it.</p>



<h2>Logo</h2>



<p>The logo is the first element your visitors will see on your website&#8217;s homepage headline. Here are some important tips on how to create an effective logo and use it to your advantage:</p>



<h3>Make it eye-catching:</h3>



<p>Your logo is a way to brand yourself and your company. Hire an experienced designer to create one that instantly attracts attention and inspires visitors.</p>



<h3>Use optimal placement:</h3>



<p>The most common spot for a logo is the upper left corner of the page. This is where people tend to look first.</p>



<h3>Keep it simple:</h3>



<p>You want to make your logo pop without containing too many distracting elements. A minimalist design goes a long way.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="328" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Logo.png" alt="Logo" class="wp-image-30174" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Logo.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Logo-300x96.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Logo-768x246.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Logo-24x8.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Logo-36x12.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Logo-48x15.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3>Choose the right size:</h3>



<p>A bigger logo doesn’t necessarily create a better impression for your brand. In fact, this can even lead to visitors losing interest.</p>



<h3>Avoid animation:</h3>



<p>It can be tempting to animate your logo when you have the tools available. This negatively impacts user experience with the unnecessary visual noise.</p>



<h2>Site Menu and Navigation</h2>



<p>If you’ve ever been lost on a website or unable to even locate the menu icon, then you know what we’re talking about. Here are some ways to ensure that your <a href="/blog/website-navigation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visitors will be able to navigate your website</a> easily:</p>



<h3>Achieve consistency:</h3>



<p>Use a logical layout for all important features. This helps people know what to expect and leads them to where exactly they want to go. After all, you want your potential customers to be able to find all of the other pages of your website!</p>



<h3>Include lean options:</h3>



<p>The more options you have, the more confusing it is for visitors. A website with too many features can be difficult to navigate and even cause decision fatigue.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="663" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Keywords.png" alt="Keywords" class="wp-image-30175" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Keywords.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Keywords-300x194.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Keywords-768x497.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Keywords-24x16.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Keywords-36x23.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Keywords-48x31.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3>Describe each tab:</h3>



<p>Use on-point labels that reflect the exact service you’re offering. Instead of simply using “Services,” assign a specific name to avoid vague descriptions.</p>



<h3>Use the hamburger icon:</h3>



<p>This standard icon with the three horizontal lines is not only recognizable but also enhances site navigation and helps users quickly navigate your website. Place the word “Menu” beside it so it’s easier to locate.</p>



<h3>Provide access to your blog:</h3>



<p>Give users a chance to read your blog articles and access your work with previous clients. The blog adds value to their lives, and the case studies help you earn their trust.</p>



<h2>Be a Homepage Hero</h2>



<p>You may have noticed the large image on a homepage that captures your attention. This is what you call the “hero shot,” or your website’s main photo. Here are some ways to use it effectively:</p>



<h3>Let the hero image represent your brand:</h3>



<p>Because the hero shot is the biggest photo on your homepage, it should tell visitors what your brand is all about. The image should be able to explain right away how they can benefit from your products or services.</p>



<h3>Aim for coherence:</h3>



<p>Make sure that the hero shot you choose will blend well with your brand. An image that has little connection to your vision and values cannot inspire interaction.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="706" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Hero-Image-3.png" alt="Hero Image 3" class="wp-image-30176" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Hero-Image-3.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Hero-Image-3-300x207.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Hero-Image-3-768x530.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Hero-Image-3-24x17.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Hero-Image-3-36x25.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Hero-Image-3-48x33.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3>Keep it straightforward:</h3>



<p>Make it simple, make it fit, and make it your brand! What the photo represents must be easy enough to understand.</p>



<h3>Make it meaningful:</h3>



<p>A well-thought-out image helps highlight your company values. Choose an authentic shot relevant to your brand rather than a stock photo that appears fake.</p>



<h2>A Clear Value Proposition</h2>



<p>Ever heard of the term WIFM? It stands for, “What’s in it for me?” And, this is exactly what people have in mind the first time they see your homepage content. To create a clear-value proposition and in a few words, remember the following points:</p>



<h3>Make your brand the answer:</h3>



<p>People are always looking for value, and this is what they should get the first time they visit your website. You must let them know that you have something that can benefit them a great deal.</p>



<h3>Tie it with your hero shot:</h3>



<p>Place your tagline near the main image. Make sure the text properly exemplifies what the photo is portraying.</p>



<h3>Provide a clear message:</h3>



<p>Be clear about how you can help. This text must explain what you do and highlight the key points of your brand offering. Your website&#8217;s written content should include a clear description and only the most important and valuable information.</p>



<h3>Make it catchy:</h3>



<p>Your headline is what people read right away and associate with your business. A great example is Huemor’s “We Create Memorable Websites That Sell.”</p>

<h2>And Action</h2>



<p>Every homepage content needs a well-worded CTA or “call to action.” Here are some ways to make your CTA work for you:</p>



<h3>Get your message across:</h3>



<p>An effective CTA creates a sense of need, an urgency that is hard to pass up. If your CTA can achieve this, you’re golden.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="486" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CTA-3.png" alt="CTA 3" class="wp-image-30179" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CTA-3.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CTA-3-300x142.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CTA-3-768x365.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CTA-3-24x11.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CTA-3-36x17.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CTA-3-48x23.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3>Use command verbs:</h3>



<p>Always use action words to establish your point and encourage visitors on what to do.</p>



<h3>Use the first-person:</h3>



<p>This perspective lets you take ownership of your brand. It also lends you a confident tone, which builds credibility.</p>



<h3>Emphasize the value:</h3>



<p>Mention the value that your visitors will get when they click on your CTA button. This should be clear from the get-go.</p>



<h3>Offer free tools:</h3>



<p>Give your visitors access to free materials like PDF downloads. Users will feel they’re getting great value and will be more likely to support your brand.</p>



<h3>Build your subscription:</h3>



<p>Encourage visitors to sign up and receive emails from your business. They may not be ready yet, but they certainly have great potential to become customers.</p>



<h2>More Proof?</h2>



<p>Your visitors will need convincing that your product or service is the one they’re looking for. This is where your proof building will come in handy for your homepage content:</p>



<h3>Publish social proof:</h3>



<p>Make positive statements from people who believe in your brand accessible. <a href="/blog/how-to-use-testimonials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Well-formatted testimonials help elevate your status</a> in your chosen field or niche.</p>



<h3>Use statistics:</h3>



<p>Numbers provide evidence of how well your product or service is doing. They offer a preview of your brand’s capacity to help.</p>



<h3>Provide images:</h3>



<p>Photos are another way to prove how much your brand is making a difference. They confirm how wide your reach is in terms of location and groups of people.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="378" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Proof-4.png" alt="Proof 4" class="wp-image-30180" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Proof-4.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Proof-4-300x111.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Proof-4-768x284.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Proof-4-24x9.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Proof-4-36x13.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Proof-4-48x18.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>Blogs and Resources</h2>



<p>Your blog is a direct route for convincing visitors that your product or service can be a huge game-changer for them. Here are ways to make blogging work for your brand:</p>



<h3>Write engaging posts:</h3>



<p>If you want to encourage visitors to read your content, write interesting articles. Use attention-grabbing titles and a story format that’s easy to follow.</p>



<h3>Make articles easy to find:</h3>



<p>If your blog posts are out of sight from the navigation bar, it will be hard to convince visitors of the value you can give them.</p>



<h3>Use a grid format:</h3>



<p>A gridlike setup offers a clean design for your blog, thus making articles easy to access. Feature posts with catchy featured images with descriptions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="486" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Blogs-and-Resources.png" alt="Blogs and Resources" class="wp-image-30181" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Blogs-and-Resources.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Blogs-and-Resources-300x142.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Blogs-and-Resources-768x365.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Blogs-and-Resources-24x11.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Blogs-and-Resources-36x17.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Blogs-and-Resources-48x23.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3>Provide a teaser:</h3>



<p>Include a section for your blog that highlights top posts or recent articles on your homepage. But, only give a preview and not too much information!</p>



<h3>Don’t forget your CTA:</h3>



<p>Use a “Read More!” CTA to ensure that visitors will end up clicking the link to your posts after reading the previews.</p>



<h2>Keywords</h2>



<p>Your homepage content should be SEO-friendly, meaning the keywords you use for all content are optimized and will show up on a standard search. Here are ways to win this technical game:</p>



<h3>Do your research:</h3>



<p>You can’t simply write content and expect people to quickly find your site on the first search. Use keywords that rank the highest and use them for your homepage.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="663" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Keywords-1.png" alt="Keywords 1" class="wp-image-30182" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Keywords-1.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Keywords-1-300x194.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Keywords-1-768x497.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Keywords-1-24x16.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Keywords-1-36x23.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Keywords-1-48x31.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3>Know where to put your keywords:</h3>



<p>Place keywords strategically in your title, headline, menu, alternative text for images, as well as your meta descriptions.</p>



<h3>Avoid overstuffing:</h3>



<p>Using keywords more than the recommended number of times can be counterproductive. You can use the right SEO tools to build a searchable homepage.</p>



<h2>Footer</h2>



<p>The footer requires an awesome design, yet it is one of the most overlooked parts of a homepage as the footer is a key element of your website homepage content. The footer is just as important as any other aspect because it contains the following elements:</p>



<h3>Contact information:</h3>



<p>This includes your company’s mobile and landline numbers.</p>



<h3>Location:</h3>



<p>This provides your registered business address and physical branches if applicable.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="378" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Footer.png" alt="Footer" class="wp-image-30183" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Footer.png 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Footer-300x111.png 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Footer-768x284.png 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Footer-24x9.png 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Footer-36x13.png 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Footer-48x18.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3>Social media platforms:</h3>



<p>These links will lead them to your company’s official Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest accounts, and more.</p>



<h3>Resources:</h3>



<p>If your company is partnered up with other platforms or organizations, this is where you encourage visitors to visit other related sites.</p>



<h3>Email sign-up:</h3>



<p>This is a perfect way to build your mailing list and generate leads.</p>



<h3>Final Call to Action or CTA:</h3>



<p>This is where you find the “Contact Us” link to invite people to send you a message and request more information or schedule a call to talk to someone from your team.</p>

<h2>To Sum It Up</h2>



<p>Your website homepage content is your ticket to creating a positive impression of your brand to your future customers. That’s why it’s important to spend time and effort building an effective one.

Do your research, hire a professional, and <a href="/blog/top-homepage-design-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">look for great examples of homepages</a> that will inspire you to build your own.</p>



<p>Most importantly, always keep your target audience and customer in mind and the way they want to access information on your homepage. Your best bet is to navigate your website from the perspective of visitors and see how well it ranks with engagement and ease of use.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Launching a website is one of the most stressful parts of any web development project. Many things can be easily overlooked during a website&#8217;s launch, even when it’s handled by the most seasoned experts.</p>



<span id="more-29672"></span>



<p>Forgetting to test a data capture point can lead to the site missing out on gathering a significant portion of new leads. Meanwhile, a site that hasn’t been set up correctly may lag behind in search rankings. And it takes only a single mistake to redo many processes in developing a new website or even redeveloping an existing website.</p>



<p>If you’ve owned and operated a website for quite some time, you know that its design is crucial for its effectiveness in driving leads and sales.</p>



<p>Right now, you may feel like your site is starting to look outdated compared to those of your competitors. It might be that you’re experiencing low traffic recently despite the growing market demand. With the issues plaguing your site, you might be considering a <a href="/blog/website-redesign" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website redesign and wondering how you might go about it</a>.</p>



<p>No matter the case, it’s important to have a reliable launch checklist you can follow to ensure your new site has the highest probability to be successful.</p>



<p>To help you with its launch, we’ve prepared a guide that will help you to get your site off the ground. You can expect guidance on the following aspects of your website launch:</p>



<ul><li>Technical and server</li><li>SEO and content</li><li>Design</li><li>Analytics</li><li>Things to test</li><li>Post-launch</li></ul>



<p>Without further ado, here are the most important website launch tips you should consider when doing a redesign.</p>

});
</script>
</div></div>



<h2>Technical and Server</h2>



<p>The following are the things you should do for your website’s server as well as other technical aspects of your site’s layout:</p>



<p>Obtain required licenses for third-party plugins and software: You want to ensure that all third-party plugins and software for your website have all the necessary licenses to operate as needed. Although using a temporary license as people develop the site is acceptable, you want to switch to permanent ones that will continue to work even as the website goes live.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Incorporate Secure Sockets Layers (SSL) protocol:</span></h4>



<p>This protocol verifies the ID of a site while allowing for more security in terms of data transfer with Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). A website that doesn’t have the SSL protocol in place may have a “not secure” label attached to it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="328" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/security-1.jpg" alt="security 1" class="wp-image-30187" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/security-1.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/security-1-300x96.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/security-1-768x246.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/security-1-24x8.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/security-1-36x12.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/security-1-48x15.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update the content management system (CMS) you’re using:</span></h4>



<p>Updating your CMS ensures that your site remains stable even after the launch while providing you with the latest features.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Perform a backup of your current website:</span></h4>



<p>This “just in case” option can be critical, especially since it provides you with something to fall back on in case things go wrong with the launch. You can also use a backup of your site to trace back and see which part of the website caused a specific problem. This will also help in creating an existing database of your site&#8217;s previous pages such as the landing page and various homepage displays.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Make sure your email authentication records are updated:</span></h4>



<p>Your Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and DomainKeys Identified Mail protocols are necessary for authenticating an IP and domain address. Having these records on hand ensures that you can send emails to their target destinations soon after launch.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Check to see that your CDN is configured correctly:</span></h4>



<p>Your content delivery network allows for fast asset transfers on loading various internet content such as images, videos, HTML pages, stylesheets, and Javascript files.</p>



<h2>SEO and Content</h2>



<p>This website checklist involves everything you need for SEO and your site’s content:</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ensure the robots.txt file of your website is updated:</span></h4>



<p>A properly configured robots.txt file will inform search engine crawlers which pages they should index on your site. Besides helping avoid overloading your website with index requests, an ideal robots.txt file will also benefit its search engine optimization (SEO) aspect.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ensure that all site versions resolve to a single version:</span></h4>



<p>The modern websites we are now using have at least four different versions (for example, https://site-name.com, http://site-name.com, https://www.site-name.com, and http://www.site-name.com). There’s no one site variant that is better than the others, yet it’s crucial that you configure these sites to point towards one URL that’s easy to recognize. This benefits not only your SEO but also your site’s user experience.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Revise the tags and meta data used on your website:</span></h4>



<p>For your technical SEO components you want to prioritize your targeted keywords and key phrases first. From there, you can work on your title tags and meta tags to ensure that they are different for each page. Page titles are also important and can help differentiate your new website. This will help make your new website state out for major search engines and allow for easier search engine indexing.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Format your headings:</span></h4>



<p>You’ll want to make sure you have proper headings above your website&#8217;s body text and ensure these are formatted correctly with the proper font size. These should enhance readability and be consistent across your web pages.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="663" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Headings-1.jpg" alt="Headings 1" class="wp-image-30188" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Headings-1.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Headings-1-300x194.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Headings-1-768x497.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Headings-1-24x16.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Headings-1-36x23.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Headings-1-48x31.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Source: <a href="http://kabertech.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KaberTech</a></figcaption></figure>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Check that all of your links are connected correctly:</span></h4>



<p>You want all of your links to other pages to be linked accordingly and not redirected to irrelevant locations. This is a great opportunity to check for any possible broken links that may include internal and external links.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">All pages should have the necessary elements included:</span></h4>



<p>Make sure that each web page on your site has the appropriate body texts, calls to action, and images present. You should consider adding alt text for CTAs and images in case there are problems loading your site. Do some usability testing and make sure those CTAs are working as they should!</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Configure redirects properly:</span></h4>



<p>Make sure that any web page URL that has changed should incorporate a redirect. It should link from its original location to the new destination to provide users with a seamless browsing experience.</p>



<p>Block thank you and confirmation pages from Google indexing. These two types of pages have little SEO value and should not compete with your other pages in the search rankings.</p>



<h2>Design</h2>



<p>Here is the checklist for the overall design of your website:</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Review all of the images on your website:</span></h4>



<p>An important part of this website checklist is to ensure that all images you use have been reviewed before launch. You want to ensure those obtained from outside sources should have the appropriate licenses to avoid penalties.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Standardize your website’s fonts:</span></h4>



<p>You want to ensure that everything stays consistent throughout each web page on your site. The most convenient way to do this is to create your own style guide before development begins so that you can significantly cut down on the time needed for this step.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Double-check the accessibility of your website’s design:</span></h4>



<p>You want to make sure that the fonts and colors used in your site are easy for users to read, with high contrast between the background and text. Screen readers should be able to read the content on your site to users, and multimedia content should have captions that allow users to watch videos without needing to hear them. Finally, you should make your website navigable even by just using the keyboard, mouse, or voice. You can check out our <a href="/blog/our-secret-to-ada-site-compliance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WCAG and ADA article</a> for more details on this.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Your navigation menus should be intuitive and easy to use:</span></h4>



<p>Users should not have to click through pages of menus to find what they need. If they do, they’re likely to leave your site or at least have a frustrating experience. Make it easy for your website users by making your menus clear, simple, and easy to navigate.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Create a favicon and custom app icon:</span></h4>



<p>You can create your own unique favicon and custom app icon to make it easier for people to recognize your site when it is bookmarked, added to a user’s home screen, or in a web browser tab.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Make sure your site should have a custom featured image on each page:</span></h4>



<p>These images are important in engaging site visitors that arrive on your website and can help improve overall site design.</p>

<h2>Analytics</h2>



<p>Analytics is a must-have feature for today’s websites. Failing to keep track and maintain positive analytics will make a site fall down in rankings.</p>



<p>Here are the things to consider in terms of analytics:</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Set up Google Analytics for your site:</span></h4>



<p>You want free tools such as <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/academy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Analytics</a> up and running for your website so that it can track the performance of each web page. This tool is extremely useful since it ties directly to your search engine optimization. You want to make sure that all relevant social media tracking scripts are set up and working as intended. You’ll also want to filter the IP addresses of you and your employees, so it does not affect your analytics.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="706" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Analytics-1.jpg" alt="Analytics 1" class="wp-image-30191" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Analytics-1.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Analytics-1-300x207.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Analytics-1-768x530.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Analytics-1-24x17.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Analytics-1-36x25.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Analytics-1-48x33.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Link your website to Google Search Console:</span></h4>



<p>The <a href="https://search.google.com/search-console/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Search Console</a> web service allows your webmasters to assess the indexing status of your site and see what changes they can make to optimize its online visibility.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Set analytics goals for your website:</span></h4>



<p>Setting goals for your website will help you determine whether it is performing as intended or not. It will let you see if your site is driving traffic successfully or failing to bring in the necessary traffic to grow.</p>



<h2>Things to Test</h2>



<p>Before doing a website launch, we suggest that you do a formal “user acceptance testing” first. This type of testing lets people visit your site, see if it’s working, observe for any errors, and perform tests before it goes live.</p>



<p>Here are the things you need to test before launching your redesigned website:</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Compare designs to other web pages:</span></h4>



<p>Performing comparison checks on other pages within the site helps ensure that everything is correct and consistent. Site users want the best experience possible when browsing and will prefer sites that offer consistency in that regard.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Test all of the forms on your website before launch:</span></h4>



<p>Make sure that you test areas like the Contact Us page, Demo page, and email responses to see if they work properly. You want to see that the emails can reach inboxes successfully upon form completion. Then, you should check that the CRM or marketing automation system you are using can successfully receive key data for new contacts or deals.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Test storage locations:</span></h4>



<p>Check and make sure that all locations where uploads and downloads happen are working properly.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Test for site compatibility:</span></h4>



<p>You want your website to be compatible with all browsers and mobile devices for maximum reach. You can use tools like <a href="https://www.lambdatest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LambdaTest</a> to emulate and test various screens since it will inform you of any incompatibilities that you can fix. By running browser tests you are making sure your new website is working properly via different browsers and that all of the site&#8217;s pages are able to be viewed on browsers such as Chrome, Safari, etc. as well as on a mobile device such as a phone or tablet.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="706" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/things-to-test-cernucci-2.jpg" alt="things to test cernucci 2" class="wp-image-30192" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/things-to-test-cernucci-2.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/things-to-test-cernucci-2-300x207.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/things-to-test-cernucci-2-768x530.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/things-to-test-cernucci-2-24x17.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/things-to-test-cernucci-2-36x25.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/things-to-test-cernucci-2-48x33.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Test your website speed:</span></h4>



<p>It’s important for any website today to load everything in a reasonable amount of time. Sites that are unable to load in under 3 seconds start to experience high bounce rates. You can use professional tools like <a href="https://gtmetrix.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GTMetrix</a> that will provide you with in-depth insights on which areas are problematic and what could be causing your site to load slowly.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Check that all links lead to the right place:</span></h4>



<p>You want to be meticulous here and ensure that all links on your site will lead people to their intended destinations. Tools like <a href="https://www.deadlinkchecker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeadLink</a> can make this process easier due to its automated features, but you should still perform manual reviews just to be sure.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Proofread all website copy:</span></h4>



<p>Proofreading is vital for any website copy published since it directly affects brand reputation. You can use browser extensions such as <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grammarly</a> to speed up the proofreading process. However, you should still check your site’s copy manually by going through all of the content.</p>



<h2>Post-Launch</h2>



<p>At this point, we’ve already gone through most of the tips in our launch checklist and are ready for your launch date. So, this means that you can now launch your redesigned site for all the world to see!</p>



<p>From here, the next step is to ensure that everything is working as intended after the website has been published live. Here are the things you need to do:</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Monitor your site analytics:</span></h4>



<p>As a continuation after setting up the website’s analytics, you want to ensure that all of the data you need is coming in successfully. The information that you receive from Google Analytics is essential for you to know if each aspect of your site is working as intended.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Check links to third-party sites:</span></h4>



<p>You want to make sure that any external links you have directing people to third-party websites have been updated and are viewable. The <a href="/blog/website-navigation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website navigation</a> experience of your users will suffer if you have links, such as that to your social channels and other relevant sites, which lead to different pages or dead ends.</p>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Announce the new website launch:</span></h4>



<p>If everything is working as intended, you can finally let your users or customers know about your newly-launched website. Your website is live, and all of your hard work should pay off in the coming months.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="663" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Launch-alerts-1.jpg" alt="Launch alerts 1" class="wp-image-30193" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Launch-alerts-1.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Launch-alerts-1-300x194.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Launch-alerts-1-768x497.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Launch-alerts-1-24x16.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Launch-alerts-1-36x23.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Launch-alerts-1-48x31.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Alright, so here&#8217;s the scenario. You&#8217;re a marketing manager in charge of ensuring certain goals are accomplished for your organization.</p>



<span id="more-29674"></span>



<p>There&#8217;s a problem, though. You don&#8217;t have either the time or the budget to do a <a href="/blog/website-redesign" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complete website redesign</a>.</p>



<p>What do you do?</p>



<p>There are a ton of ways one can go about improving a website, but we&#8217;ve taken the liberty to narrow them down to the 10 things we feel will make the BIGGEST impact on your website WITHOUT having to redesign the entire thing from the ground up. So how do you improve your website? Get ready to ways to improve your website design!</p>



<h2>Make It Faster</h2>



<p>User experience is greatly influenced by the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/speed-up-a-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speed of a website</a>. <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/data-measurement/mobile-page-speed-new-industry-benchmarks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Google</a>, increasing loading times from one to three seconds raises the likelihood of a visitor abandoning the website by 32%.</p>



<p>Site speed also plays a vital role in conversion rates. In fact, <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-strategies/app-and-mobile/mobile-page-speed-conversion-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research by Google</a> reveals that conversions might drop by up to 20% for every second that a mobile page takes to load. Furthermore, faster websites can lift conversion rates by up to 40%.</p>



<p>In many cases, speeding up your website and website design can be relatively easy to do. Here are <a href="https://www.hostgator.com/blog/fix-slow-loading-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some quick fixes</a> that can make your site load faster:</p>



<ul><li>Compress and optimize your images and videos</li><li>Limit the amount that loads on a single page</li><li>Enable caching</li><li>Use a CDN</li></ul>



<p>Improving website overall page speed is critical for attracting visitors and keeping them interested.</p>



<div class="huemorProtip-container" style="background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><h2 class="huemorProtip-title" style="color:black">Protip</h2><p style="color:black" class="huemorProtip-description">If you&#8217;re interested in learning more about what we can do for you, check out our offers <a href="https://huemor.rocks/services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>!</p><div class="huemorProtip-button"></div></div>



<h2>Make It Consistent</h2>



<p>Design is all about consistency. The consistency of your website&#8217;s design and content is critical if you want to give your visitors a pleasant online experience. It can make the difference between a good and bad user experience.</p>



<p>Even if you&#8217;re not in love with your visual design, it may be made worse by being inconsistent. Make sure that fonts, font sizes, font weights, colors, treatments to elements such as corner rounding, and borders are consistent across all pages. This will improve how professional the website appears regardless of whether or not the web design is the best it can be.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="543" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/consistency-glossier.jpg" alt="consistency glossier" class="wp-image-30200" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/consistency-glossier.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/consistency-glossier-300x159.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/consistency-glossier-768x407.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/consistency-glossier-24x13.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/consistency-glossier-36x19.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/consistency-glossier-48x25.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption> <a href="https://www.glossier.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glossier</a> </figcaption></figure>



<p>For example, consistency is evident on the <a href="https://www.glossier.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glossier</a> website because it employs a color palette that matches its products. It is also able to add a few splashes of color to each page without going excessive or deviating from its identity. Also make the most of your website&#8217;s white space, do not over crowd your website with unneeded content but also do not leave blank canvas blank!</p>



<h2>Improve Your Opening Statement</h2>



<p>The copy on your homepage has a significant impact on its success. It&#8217;ll be the first thing visitors see when they come to your website and can be used as a brief &#8220;elevator pitch&#8221; to explain the purpose of your site. As a result, your website&#8217;s opening statement must be engaging.</p>



<p>You should have a clear opening statement that makes it obvious what you do, who you do it for, and why you do it. If you don&#8217;t, then you&#8217;re starting off on the wrong foot with your potential customers. Improving this statement will immediately help prospective customers connect with your company.</p>



<p>For instance, <a href="http://kabertech.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaber Tech</a> features an excellent opening statement on their website. They have a catchy headline and a statement that illustrates what makes their products different.</p>



<h2>Re-organize Your Website Navigation</h2>



<p>One of the most crucial aspects of a website is its navigation. It helps visitors quickly and effortlessly discover the content they&#8217;re looking for, such as a blog post or a product page.</p>



<p>To make your website navigation effective, make sure all of your key pages are being represented. What are those key pages? These are areas of your site that are popular with visitors. You can use Google Analytics to help you understand what those pages are. Using the <a href="https://measureschool.com/navigation-report-google-analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Navigation Summary Report feature</a>, you&#8217;ll learn which pages people go to the most. This also ensures that the navigation is intuitive to how your customers would browse the website.</p>



<p>Another crucial factor is to make sure the navigation isn&#8217;t overwhelming. The navigation menu on your website is not the place for amusing gimmicks. Use the cleanest design and wording possible to ensure that your audience understands what you&#8217;re trying to convey. In addition, the adage &#8220;less is more&#8221; applies. Don&#8217;t bombard guests with too many items on your menu.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="543" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/navigation-gleamin.jpg" alt="navigation gleamin" class="wp-image-30199" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/navigation-gleamin.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/navigation-gleamin-300x159.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/navigation-gleamin-768x407.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/navigation-gleamin-24x13.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/navigation-gleamin-36x19.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/navigation-gleamin-48x25.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption> <a href="http://gleamin.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gleamin</a> (Check out our <a href="https://huemor.rocks/case-studies/gleamin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">case study</a>) </figcaption></figure>



<p>Over time websites grow, but often navigation systems don&#8217;t grow with them. As such, it&#8217;s essential to update your website navigation regularly for the best possible user experience.</p>



<p>An example of a website that has excellent navigation is <a href="https://www.stories.com/en_usd/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Other Stories</a>. The site features clear navigation options that allow users to easily find different product categories.</p>



<div class="huemorProtip-container" style="background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><h2 class="huemorProtip-title" style="color:black">Protip</h2><p style="color:black" class="huemorProtip-description">Check out our article for more detailed tips on how to design a truly effective <a href="/blog/website-navigation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">website navigation</a>.</p><div class="huemorProtip-button"></div></div>



<h2>Add Social Proof</h2>



<p>Your website will soar if you provide social proof. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2021/10/07/4-powerful-ways-to-show-social-proof-on-your-website/?sh=5c71a0d92479" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social proof</a> is a marketing approach based on the premise that if people witness others doing something, they are more inclined to do it themselves. If a shopper is undecided about what you&#8217;re offering, they will frequently look or ask around to see what others say about it before making a purchase. Potential buyers get the impression that they&#8217;re not by themselves. <a href="https://geekflare.com/social-proof-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social proof</a> lets them know that many people believe in the brand and use it to their advantage. As a result, they have many good reasons to put it to use for themselves as well.</p>



<p>One way to show social proof on your website is to add testimonials or reviews. This can help you gain a lot of new customers. In fact, <a href="https://bizrateinsights.com/resources/shopper-survey-report-the-impact-reviews-have-on-consumers-purchase-decisions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">91% of customers</a> read internet reviews before purchasing something. Furthermore, testimonials can boost <a href="https://www.impactbnd.com/blog/whats-changed-with-social-proof-in-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sales page conversions by 34%</a>.</p>



<div class="huemorProtip-container" style="background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><h2 class="huemorProtip-title" style="color:black">Protip</h2><p style="color:black" class="huemorProtip-description">Want to learn more out how to use use testimonials on your website? Read more <a href="/blog/how-to-use-testimonials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>!</p><div class="huemorProtip-button"></div></div>



<p>Including ratings and reviews on your website allows your visitors to see what other people have to say. Make sure they&#8217;re on crucial pages, that they serve to reinforce what you&#8217;re offering, and that they were made recently by previous customers.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.wearfigs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Figs</a> demonstrates how social proof can be used on a website. Their product pages feature a tab where customers can check ratings and reviews.</p>



<h2>Simplify Contact Forms</h2>



<p>An effective contact form is one of the most crucial parts of your website. A potential customer has no idea how trustworthy you and your product are. They might have concerns about how to use your product, or they might want to put your customer support to the test by asking a query and seeing what kind of response they get.</p>



<p>Because contact forms are used to link online visitors with their objectives, design and user experience can heavily influence conversion rates. Here are some ways to simplify your contact forms.</p>



<h3>Shorter Contact Forms Perform Better</h3>



<p>When a form has too many fields, it can be too much for people to handle, and they may abandon it. Reducing the number of needed fields makes it easier to fill out the form and prevents the user from feeling overwhelmed. According to <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/contact-form-conversion-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QuickSprout research</a>, a three-field form had a 25% conversion rate. Those percentages were lowered to 20% for up to 5 fields and 15% for more than 6 fields. As a result, the maximum number of fields should be 5, and the tab order should be correct.</p>



<h3>Keep What You Need To Know to the Bare Minimum</h3>



<p>As a general rule, people are reluctant to share personal details such as their contact number or address. Asking for these details can result in a high rate of form abandonment. According to <a href="https://komarketing.com/resources/b2b-web-usability-report-2015/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KoMarketing</a>, phone numbers are the most common piece of information that consumers do not want to enter on a form, at 58%. This is even more relevant nowadays, given the rise in the number of spam calls. Home address closely follows at 53%.</p>

<h3>Less Friction = More Conversions</h3>



<p>When designing a contact form, you should focus on making it as easy as possible for people to get in touch with you. Ensure that the user can quickly and progressively move through the fields by arranging the tab order. The final tab arrangement of the Submit and Cancel buttons is critical to avoid users from mistakenly canceling the form. Another option to reduce friction is to use in-line validation. Before submitting an inquiry, certain Javascripts can notify visitors if their email address is incorrect. Nothing is more frustrating than having to find an error after you&#8217;ve already tried to submit your data.</p>



<h2>Add New Ways To Capture Contact Information</h2>



<p>Not everyone visiting your website will be ready to buy, but they may be in the future. As such, it will be to your advantage if you can collect the contact information of potential leads. Gathering email addresses from your website visitors is vital to building a community of loyal customers. Email marketing has also been proven to have one of the highest returns on investment among digital marketing strategies at <a href="https://www.lyfemarketing.com/blog/email-marketing-roi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">122%</a>.</p>



<p>Here are some improvements you can make on your site that can create additional opportunities for people to reveal who they are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Use newsletter opt-in forms on your website:</strong> Creating opt-in forms that let users submit their email and sign up for your emails is the easiest and quickest way to gather email addresses.</li><li><strong>Add new forms that offer specific resources or content:</strong> This might be in the form of an eBook, white paper, webinar, or anything else that provides consumers with essential knowledge.</li></ul>



<h2>Create New Content</h2>



<p>Quality content distinguishes your website from the competition and sends the right message to your customers&#8217; hearts and minds. Your website&#8217;s success is driven mainly by its content. As such, you need to focus on creating new content relevant to your target audience. This could be new service pages, new case studies, white papers, ebooks, and blog posts. Fresh content shows you&#8217;re still moving forward, are active, and are a successful business.</p>



<p>Building relationships with your customers is one of the main benefits of producing quality content. You&#8217;ll be able to answer their inquiries and engage with them. Content has the power to create pleasant customer experiences and encourage them to return for more.</p>



<h2>Update Photos and Videos</h2>



<p>Audiovisual elements such as photographs, illustrations, and videos look fantastic on a website and help engage visitors by breaking up text-heavy sections. However, keeping your media up-to-date is also crucial in improving website performance.</p>



<p>Check the corporate headshots on your site. Are they more than five years out of date? If so, then it&#8217;s time to update them. Posting new photos of projects and facilities can also help show growth.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/644959901?h=ee6c13e634&amp;dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Make sure your visual elements are of the highest quality and relevance. Take note of anything that appears grainy, pixelated, or out-of-date. You can come across photos that aren&#8217;t relevant anymore or aren&#8217;t consistent with your current branding. Removing or replacing these elements can give your website a new and fresh look. Even if your website template isn&#8217;t brand new, new images and videos can still elevate your website.</p>



<h2>Clean-Up 404&#8217;s</h2>



<p>A 404 error is issued when a server is unable to locate the precise URL that the browser has requested. It&#8217;s the dreaded screen that reads: &#8220;this page cannot be found.&#8221; Individually, 404 errors may appear insignificant, but their cumulative effect on a site can be severe. 404 errors on a business website are a surefire way to lose money and irritate visitors at the same time.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="543" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/404-huemor.jpg" alt="404 huemor" class="wp-image-30197" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/404-huemor.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/404-huemor-300x159.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/404-huemor-768x407.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/404-huemor-24x13.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/404-huemor-36x19.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/404-huemor-48x25.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>First and foremost, 404 errors hurt SEO. Google and other search engines won&#8217;t index pages that return a 404 error code because it means the page doesn&#8217;t exist. Furthermore, they also hurt user experience. 404 errors can be frustrating for visitors and cause them to leave a website. Because of this, you&#8217;ll see a rise in the bounces and exit rates of your site. Customers and sales can potentially be lost due to 404 errors.</p>



<p>For these reasons, you must identify and fix these broken links. You can achieve this using tools like <a href="https://ahrefs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ahrefs</a>.</p>

<p>Are you wondering how to use testimonials to effectively draw prospective customers to your website? More importantly, are you wondering why you need customer testimonials on your website in the first place? All great questions, so let&#8217;s dive right in!</p>



<p>Getting the trust of your audience, as well as potential buyers is the most important part of getting more conversions. To do this, you need to use customer testimonials. Below are a few tips and testimonial examples to help your website (and, ultimately, your business):</p>



<span id="more-29676"></span>



<div class="ChapterFullwidth" style="background-image:url(https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-form">
<a id="chapter 1"></a>
</div><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">CHAPTER 1</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">What is the Goal of a Testimonial?</h2></div></div>



<p>Testimonials are used to boost the confidence of your prospective customers. Seeing that your products or services are reliable, they will trust your business more and the quality that it has. Testimonials are often used to generate leads and attain new customers for this reason.</p>



<p>Along with this, testimonials build trust with your audience because they back up the claims you’ve made about what your business does best. Anybody can say “my products are the best on the market.” But can everyone prove it? More often than not, no. Testimonials are a way to stand out in an industry with a lot of sales claims and limited data &#8212; or perhaps false data &#8212; to back them up.</p>



<div class="ChapterFullwidth" style="background-image:url(https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-form">
<a id="chapter 2"></a>
</div><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">CHAPTER 2</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">Why are Testimonials Effective?</h2></div></div>



<p>Testimonials lead to sales for two main reasons:</p>



<h3>They Add a Human Quality</h3>



<p>A lot of data can feel very impersonal. While you can prove to the world that you have X number of 5-star reviews, it’s the content of those reviews that really matter to customers. It’s how they can identify with your product or service and see themselves using it.</p>



<p>Testimonials are, of course, not reviews. But in a similar sense, the content of these testimonials will matter to your customers. Providing a human quality will allow them to relate with or sympathize with the experiences of the customers in testimonials, especially if these testimonials discuss pain points. Seeing that someone else found the solution in your business will entice them to do the same.</p>



<h3>They Create Social Proof</h3>



<p>You’ve probably heard of <a href="https://www.dynamicyield.com/glossary/social-proof/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social proof</a> before, but just as a recap, social proof is when someone uses a product or service, and then creates a chain reaction of people doing the same thing. This does not have to be a celebrity or a billionaire. It just needs to be someone that people respect and trust. Getting a testimonial from a trusted source will inevitably send customers your way looking to be like that person, or be liked by society.</p>



<p>Alternatively, a large amount of testimonials can create social proof, since people will think, “Since everyone else is doing it, I should be, too.” Ideally, you should have a mix of testimonials from people that others look up to, as well as ordinary people that fit your target demographic.</p>



<div class="ChapterFullwidth" style="background-image:url(https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-form">
<a id="chapter 3"></a>
</div><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">CHAPTER 3</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">Testimonials vs. Data and Statistics</h2></div></div>



<p>When customers want to see just how honest you are as a company, they will look for two key pieces of evidence — testimonials or data and statistics. In order to build a website that truly captures your viewers’ attention, you will need to have both placed strategically on your website.</p>



<h3>Testimonials</h3>



<p>This kind of evidence shows the quality of certain products and services, focusing on what appeals to the hearts and emotions of their target audience. As mentioned, testimonials will always come from someone who has already tried the product or service, which means they are speaking from experience.</p>

<h3>Data and Statistics</h3>



<p>This involves qualitative evidence. Think graphs, charts, figures, and the like. For example, you could conduct a survey showing how many customers are satisfied with your services.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="400" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Data-Statistics-extensis.jpg" alt="Data Statistics extensis" class="wp-image-30212" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Data-Statistics-extensis.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Data-Statistics-extensis-300x117.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Data-Statistics-extensis-768x300.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Data-Statistics-extensis-24x9.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Data-Statistics-extensis-36x14.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Data-Statistics-extensis-48x19.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://huemor.rocks/case-studies/extensishr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ExtensisHR Case Study</a></figcaption></figure>

</div><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">CHAPTER 4</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">How to Get a Great Testimonial</h2></div></div>



<h2>How to Get a Great Testimonial</h2>



<p>Now that you understand how testimonials work and just how effective they can be, you probably want some on your own website. This is a great idea but if you don’t have a customer base just yet, this won’t be easy to do. Nevertheless, you can put systems in place to get testimonials in the future.</p>



<h3>Do an Amazing Job</h3>



<p>This one is kind of obvious, but it’s the most important thing you can do for your company and brand. If you want to get good testimonials throughout your website, you have to deliver a great product or experience for your customers. Not just once or twice, but consistently — doing this each time a customer makes a purchase will lead to testimonials down the line.</p>



<h3>Ask for Testimonials</h3>



<p>A lot of companies assume that testimonials will willingly come to them, but this isn’t actually true. People will usually have better things to do than take the time to sit down and write something nice about a product they used or a service they booked. The best way to compel people to do this is to have a set of processes to ask for positive reviews with every satisfactory customer experience.</p>



<p>Ensure that you have a team to take charge of customer interactions, such as CSRs or managers, who can follow a clear set of processes. We suggest starting with fans who love your products and services. Because of this, they could already be interested or willing to help you in any way they can. All that’s left to do is ask.</p>



<h4>Email Example</h4>



<p>Whenever you’re sending an email asking for a testimonial, it needs to be concise, yet polite. A long email will confuse the sendee, and a rude email will turn them away. As such, these are the two highest priorities when sending an email.</p>



<p>Here is a template email for your reference:</p>



<p><em>Dear ____,</em></p>



<p><em>Would you be alright with writing us a short testimonial? We’re looking to update our website, and it would help us out. I can send you something to base it off of, or you can just write us a couple of sentences relating to your experiences with our company.</em></p>



<p><em>Please don’t feel obligated to do this, however. If you’d like to decline, that is completely okay. Just let me know.</em></p>



<p><em>Thank you!</em></p>



<p>Naturally, you’ll want to adjust the tone of this template depending on the way your company is branded. You might want it to be more formal than it already is, or more conversational.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, no matter how they respond, following this guideline will allow you to get what you came for nine times out of ten &#8212; a testimonial.</p>



<h3>Use Third-Party Sites for Testimonials</h3>



<p>It’s a good idea to have your customers use third-party websites where they can leave testimonials or reviews. While these third-party sites can vary depending on the industry you’re in, there are many common platforms that you can rely on, such as:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.google.com/business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Business</a></li><li><a href="https://www.g2.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">G2</a></li><li><a href="https://www.yelp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yelp</a></li><li><a href="https://foursquare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foursquare</a></li><li><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TripAdvisor</a></li><li><a href="https://www.zomato.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zomato</a></li></ul>



<p>Doing this will allow you to broaden the exposure your website receives while adding another layer of authenticity for your business. By maintaining your profile on third-party sites, you can show audiences that you are a legitimate business by having recent photos, current information, and top reviews.</p>



<p>Furthermore, having an active account that shows up-to-date information will boost results within search engines. As a result, you’ll gain the attention of more people and attract more visitors to your company and brand.</p>



<p>Along with this, third-party websites will usually display snippets to visually represent your website as soon as search results come in.</p>



<p>Bonus review source &#8211; social media! Go through your social media feed to see what feedback previous consumers have shared. This is a great way to collect feedback from real people as well! Just make sure your customer is okay with you sharing their thoughts as you want to continue to build trust for your brand.</p>

<p>Now you’re probably wondering how to write a testimonial. This will be useful when you’re making those drafts inside your emails to send to your customers. Here are a few tips on how to write effective testimonials:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="400" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Ag-America-Testimonial-1.jpg" alt="Ag America Testimonial 1" class="wp-image-30218" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Ag-America-Testimonial-1.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Ag-America-Testimonial-1-300x117.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Ag-America-Testimonial-1-768x300.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Ag-America-Testimonial-1-24x9.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Ag-America-Testimonial-1-36x14.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Ag-America-Testimonial-1-48x19.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://huemor.rocks/case-studies/ag-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-size: 12px;">AgAmerica Case Study</span></a></figcaption></figure>



<h3>Only Include Testimonials that Have Been Received Ethically</h3>



<p>This is probably another obvious piece of advice but we’ll say it anyway: Don’t invent fake testimonials. Every testimonial on your website should be 100% authentic.</p>



<p>This doesn’t mean you can paraphrase something a customer said once, either. It needs to be straight from them, and with their permission.</p>



<h3>A Good Testimonial is Concise</h3>



<p>A short and concise testimonial is the best way to deliver a message that you want people to know about. Ideally, it will have between 30 to 50 words to ensure that people will read it, rather than find a shorter one that they can easily comprehend.</p>



<p>Avoid using super-long messages — while your customers may love your work, be sure to ask for their approval to edit these down to an appropriate amount.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="400" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Concise-testimonial-1.jpg" alt="Concise testimonial 1" class="wp-image-30220" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Concise-testimonial-1.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Concise-testimonial-1-300x117.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Concise-testimonial-1-768x300.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Concise-testimonial-1-24x9.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Concise-testimonial-1-36x14.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Concise-testimonial-1-48x19.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://huemor.rocks/case-studies/coverfx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CoverFX Case Study</a></figcaption></figure>



<h3>A Good Testimonial is Direct</h3>



<p>As mentioned, you don’t need paragraphs and paragraphs of good words about your company. Upfront and direct messages will have more of an impact on those who read them compared to long messages. Long messages will only drown potential buyers in words, creating confusion. A testimonial that’s straight to the point makes it more understandable for your audience.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="400" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/BetterCloud-Testimonial.jpg" alt="BetterCloud Testimonial" class="wp-image-30221" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/BetterCloud-Testimonial.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/BetterCloud-Testimonial-300x117.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/BetterCloud-Testimonial-768x300.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/BetterCloud-Testimonial-24x9.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/BetterCloud-Testimonial-36x14.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/BetterCloud-Testimonial-48x19.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://huemor.rocks/case-studies/better-cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BetterCloud Case Study</a></figcaption></figure>



<h3>A Good Testimonial is Authentic</h3>



<p>It only makes sense that the more information there is in a testimonial, the more authentic and credible it is. A testimonial should have a person’s name, title, picture, and in some cases, their company.</p>



<p>Along with this, the best testimonials will show the personality of the person leaving them, conveying emotion and leaving readers to experience their happiness with the product or service secondhand.</p>

<h3>Some Aren’t Written At All</h3>



<p>Video testimonials are a great way to present the story of how a person truly feels about the service or product you offer. When a potential buyer sees someone, hears their tone, and views their mannerisms, it can truly add a lot of credibility.</p>



<p>Visual endorsements are also more engaging. According to Forbes, viewers are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/yec/2017/07/13/how-to-incorporate-video-into-your-social-media-strategy/?sh=5e4f3bda7f2e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">95% more likely</a> to understand and keep the message of a video compared to text. It is all about tailoring your content to what your potential customers want to know from real people and clients. This increases the likelihood they will purchase a product or service from your business as well as help to boost sales.</p>

</div><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">CHAPTER 6</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">What&#8217;s the Anatomy of an Effective Testimonial?</h2></div></div>



<p>While having testimonials is great, you shouldn’t just post them for the sake of having them on your website. You also need to make sure that we have a few key components in place to ensure that you don’t lose your credibility. Here are a few things to consider:</p>



<h3>Is it Relevant?</h3>



<p>Be sure to check if the testimonial actually talks about your business — it’s easy to fill pages with testimonials but do they actually matter to your business today? Make sure that they capture your audiences’ attention by picking out only the most relevant pieces for your business.</p>



<p>A relevant testimonial will talk about the specific products and services you offer or anything new that you will soon be offering. They will also remain consistent regarding who you are as a company and what you represent.</p>



<h3>Is there an Identifiable Source?</h3>



<p>As mentioned, a credible testimonial will come from a source that you can identify and shouldn’t be anonymous.</p>



<p>For B2B companies, a testimonial will ideally have:</p>



<ul><li>A person’s name</li><li>Their job title</li><li>Their company</li><li>Their photo</li></ul>



<p>However, if you find that a customer may not want to include a photo, a logo of their company would suffice as well. Here is an example of what a testimonial for B2B companies with an identifiable source should look like:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Quirk-b2b-testimonial.jpg" alt="Quirk b2b testimonial" class="wp-image-30223" width="840" height="328" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Quirk-b2b-testimonial.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Quirk-b2b-testimonial-300x117.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Quirk-b2b-testimonial-768x300.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Quirk-b2b-testimonial-24x9.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Quirk-b2b-testimonial-36x14.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Quirk-b2b-testimonial-48x19.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://huemor.rocks/case-studies/quirk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-size: 12px;">Quirk Creative Case Study</span></a></figcaption></figure>



<p>For D2C companies, a testimonial will ideally have:</p>



<ul><li>A person’s name</li><li>Their photo</li></ul>



<p>Here’s an example of these kinds of testimonials for D2C companies:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="838" height="375" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Gleamin-D2C-testimonial-1-2.jpg" alt="Gleamin D2C testimonial 1 2" class="wp-image-30224" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Gleamin-D2C-testimonial-1-2.jpg 838w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Gleamin-D2C-testimonial-1-2-300x134.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Gleamin-D2C-testimonial-1-2-768x344.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Gleamin-D2C-testimonial-1-2-24x11.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Gleamin-D2C-testimonial-1-2-36x16.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Gleamin-D2C-testimonial-1-2-48x21.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 838px) 100vw, 838px" /><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://gleamin.com">gleamin.com</a></figcaption></figure>



<div class="ChapterFullwidth" style="background-image:url(https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pink-blue-space-bg-compressor.jpg);background-size:cover;background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-wrapper"><div class="ChapterFullwitdh-form">
<a id="chapter 7"></a>
</div><h5 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptersectiontitle">CHAPTER 7</h5><h2 class="ChapterFullwitdh-chaptertitle">Where to Include Testimonials?</h2></div></div>



<p>No matter the kind of industry you belong to or the nature of your business, there are places on your website where testimonials need to be to produce the most desirable results. Here are just a few of those areas:</p>



<h3>Key Landing Pages</h3>



<p>Placing testimonials on your key landing pages will provide the best area for potential customers or buyers to see just how great your brand or company is. Also, having testimonials on your products or services pages will provide you with the opportunity to back up any claims you might have.</p>



<div class="huemorProtip-container" style="background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><h2 class="huemorProtip-title" style="color:black">Protip</h2><p style="color:black" class="huemorProtip-description">Much like in this example, ensure that your claims are paired with relevant testimonials. Doing this will greatly boost the effectiveness of these claims.</p><div class="huemorProtip-button"></div></div>



<h3>Your Success Stories / Portfolio / Case Studies</h3>



<p>This is where you can provide both quantitative data in the form of data &amp; statistics of outcomes as well as qualitative data using customer testimonials. As previously mentioned, having a combination of both will win over your customers’ hearts and minds.</p>



<div class="hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed" style="width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 1920px; max-height: 1080px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;">
<div class="hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;"><iframe class="hs-responsive-embed-iframe" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;" src="//player.vimeo.com/video/642720112?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=8dc7dc&amp;background=1" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-service="vimeo" width="1920" height="1080" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
</div>



<h3>Contact Pages and Checkout</h3>



<p>Having a testimonial within your <a href="https://smashballoon.com/how-to-display-testimonials-on-your-website/#reviews-on-contact-pages" target="_blank" rel="noopener">checkout or contact page</a> can be the final touch of persuasion that you need. This could just be what you need to push someone to make the decision to buy your products or services. To make this as effective as possible, make sure to save your best testimonials for last.</p>

<p>A retail website is an online platform maintained by a retailer to sell goods and services to a particular target audience. However, having one set up doesn&#8217;t automatically mean that retailers can immediately haul in customers and earn profits.</p>



<p>Web design is crucial when creating an effective retail website. A good retail website is all about accessibility, responsiveness, and the use of high-quality media, such as images and videos. A retail website should provide the best experience to users so they can <a href="/blog/website-navigation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">convert into customers</a>.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve compiled a list of the best retail websites today to help you craft yours. Our company has long been creating websites for businesses worldwide, and the retail websites below meet our criteria for user experience, high-quality content, optimization for mobile use, and accessibility.</p>



<span id="more-29678"></span>



<h2>1. <a href="https://www.allbirds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Allbirds</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="600" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Allbirds.jpg" alt="Allbirds" class="wp-image-30229" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Allbirds.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Allbirds-300x176.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Allbirds-768x450.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Allbirds-24x14.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Allbirds-36x21.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Allbirds-48x28.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Allbirds&#8217; website makes it to our list because the tone of their platform is friendly, easily builds trust, and encourages users to buy from them. Their shopping cart gives customers features free shipping to their customers. Their website design is simple yet effective. It draws the eyes to the unique images present on every webpage and allows for user interaction and user experience.</p>



<p>Even first-time users won&#8217;t have any problems using the website because it&#8217;s easy to navigate and the webpages highlight various products!</p>



<h2>2. <a href="https://swallowtailtea.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swallowtail Tea</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="675" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Swallowtail-Tea.jpg" alt="Swallowtail Tea" class="wp-image-30230" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Swallowtail-Tea.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Swallowtail-Tea-300x198.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Swallowtail-Tea-768x506.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Swallowtail-Tea-24x16.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Swallowtail-Tea-36x24.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Swallowtail-Tea-48x32.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Users will be encouraged to buy tea from Swallowtail Tea&#8217;s website because it uses a very clean design that goes well with the calming effects of tea. Although the website&#8217;s design is subtle, any information a user might want is available, from a list of on-sale items and the company’s <a href="/blog/about-us-page-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener">About Us page</a> to various teas and merchandise.</p>



<p>The product photography is on point! Each of the product images highlights the product in their online store.</p>



<h2>3. <a href="https://www.glossier.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glossier</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="591" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Glossier-1.jpg" alt="Glossier 1" class="wp-image-30231" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Glossier-1.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Glossier-1-300x173.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Glossier-1-768x443.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Glossier-1-24x14.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Glossier-1-36x21.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Glossier-1-48x28.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Glossier&#8217;s website showcases &#8220;consistency&#8221; because it uses a color palette similar to the colors of its products. It also managed to add little pops of colors to every webpage without going overboard or steering away from its brand.</p>



<p>Aside from being aesthetically pleasing, every page of the website is also informative as they display vital information that users should know about the products — from its benefits and available sizes to instructions on how to use them.</p>



<p>Another reason Glossier is on our list is because they are an ecommerce platform that allows for users to find the products they are looking for in a short amount of time due to their overall organized web design.</p>



<h2>4. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="476" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Amazon.jpg" alt="Amazon" class="wp-image-30232" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Amazon.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Amazon-300x139.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Amazon-768x357.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Amazon-24x11.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Amazon-36x17.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Amazon-48x22.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>One noteworthy feature of Amazon&#8217;s website is it displays a lot of shipping and product information without making the platform look cluttered. Users can easily find products on the website as everything is categorized properly.</p>



<p>Amazon&#8217;s website also shows products inspired by a user’s browsing history. This means that if a user searched for pellet grills, the website will then display hardwood pellets, dripping pails, and beef rubs.</p>



<h2>5. <a href="https://perkyjerky.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perky Jerky</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="651" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Perky-Jerky.jpg" alt="Perky Jerky" class="wp-image-30233" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Perky-Jerky.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Perky-Jerky-300x191.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Perky-Jerky-768x488.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Perky-Jerky-24x15.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Perky-Jerky-36x23.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Perky-Jerky-48x31.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Perky Jerky&#8217;s website stays true to its name — it uses high-quality images and bold color palettes to make the page feel and look cheerful. When accessed through a smartphone, the website also shows animations that don&#8217;t interfere with the navigation or experience of the users.</p>



<p>The products on the website are categorized so users can easily find what they&#8217;re looking for — whether they want to purchase turkey jerky, beef jerky, or vegan jerky!</p>



<h2>6. <a href="https://www.rei.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REI</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="576" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/REI.jpg" alt="REI" class="wp-image-30234" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/REI.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/REI-300x169.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/REI-768x432.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/REI-24x14.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/REI-36x20.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/REI-48x27.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The use of earthy tones on their website matches the brand of REI. Headers and footers are properly highlighted using bold shades of green, and descriptions are visible as these are presented in solid black colors.</p>



<p>If there&#8217;s one thing the website can improve on, it&#8217;s the number of categories presented on a webpage. Some users find the header and footer navigations too congested, which can become an issue down the road.</p>



<h2>7. <a href="https://tomasthan.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thomas Than</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="481" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Thomas-Than.jpg" alt="Thomas Than" class="wp-image-30235" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Thomas-Than.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Thomas-Than-300x141.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Thomas-Than-768x361.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Thomas-Than-24x11.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Thomas-Than-36x17.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Thomas-Than-48x23.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Thomas Than&#8217;s website welcomes users to their website with a choice of which version of the website users want to visit. The cleanliness of Thomas Than&#8217;s website makes it stand out from the competition. Although the website is filled with attractive models, the focus remains on the products.</p>



<p>The products on the website are also categorized into just two — men and women. This makes it more convenient for users to browse through different products and find what they&#8217;re looking for within minutes.</p>



<h2>8. <a href="https://periodaisle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aisle</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="512" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Aisle-1.jpg" alt="Aisle 1" class="wp-image-30236" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Aisle-1.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Aisle-1-300x150.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Aisle-1-768x384.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Aisle-1-24x12.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Aisle-1-36x18.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Aisle-1-48x24.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The use of bold colors is very prevalent on Aisle&#8217;s website. Bright colors of green, yellow, orange, and blue can be seen throughout the website. Even with these colors, though, the website remains clean as the colors are used strategically to create sections.</p>

<span id="more-29680"></span>



<p>Rarely does it matter who you’re ending things with. Whether it’s your significant other or your boss, parting ways can be awkward and accompanied by all sorts of emotions.</p>



<p>All breakups have one thing in common — all came after a period of good experiences. Your website design agency and yourself may have shared a positive business relationship, but anything can come to an end.</p>



<p>When it comes to severing ties with your website design agency, breaking up can be a little complicated.</p>



<p>For starters, you can lose your website and its content if things turn sour. In addition, your website design agency can make the sunsetting process a little more challenging if you aren’t careful yourself.</p>



<p>Anybody can terminate the services of an agency. However, only marketing managers worth their salt can do so with class and caution. In this article, we’ll fill you in on how to do just that and more.</p>



<p>So, stick around, put away the tissues, and read on before you change to a new website design agency!</p>



<h2>Define Your “Why”</h2>



<p>Now, we’d never recommend staying in an already exhausting relationship. Indeed, there are clear signs that it’s time to terminate the services of your website design agency.</p>



<p>Sometimes, it pays to take a step back, breathe, and evaluate the relationship. More specifically, ask yourself why you want to part ways with your website design agency.</p>



<p>A few hiccups here and there may not be good enough reasons to end things. These reasons, on the other hand, might be.</p>



<h3>1. The Agency Is Stuck in the Stone Age</h3>



<p>Building a new site has gone a long way since the 90s. Even several Content management system (CMS) platforms from the early 2000s seem obsolete to today’s no-code variety.</p>



<p>Has your agency been using the same platform for decades, or even half that time? Then, there’s a chance your site will miss out on innovations to build your online presence.</p>



<p>In truth, innovations in site development and design are popping up left and right. An agency worth its salt should jump on the opportunity to incorporate whatever useful innovations they have.</p>



<p>For most agencies, the limiting factor is the ability to adapt to change. If changing platforms or improving on them is too difficult for an agency, it may deem your interests as secondary.</p>



<p>The continued use of obsolete platforms, while mildly effective, may be a sign that it’s time to change things up. And, we don’t mean the platform, but your web design agency.</p>



<h3>2. It Seems They’ve Got Too Much on Their Plate</h3>



<p>Yes, it’s possible for your web agency to cheat on you.</p>



<p>Kidding aside, a web agency that’s got a lot of clients on board isn’t always something to admire. In fact, when it comes to your website, it might be bad news.</p>



<p>Few will deny that getting overloaded as an agency isn’t far-fetched or unlikely. But, when this happens, through nobody’s fault, some projects will fall by the wayside.</p>



<p>In such scenarios, prioritization can be challenging for the company. If you’ve observed that your web agency is living up to its end of your contract, you can stick with it.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if you’ve learned that the agency has taken on many other projects concurrent to a drop in quality, it’s time to move on.</p>



<p>Once again, it’s all about proper prioritization and management. This conveniently brings us to the next red flag before switching web design agencies.</p>



<h3>3. Poor Project Management</h3>



<p>Web design agencies handle projects using a team-based approach.</p>



<p>For instance, one person handles communication with clients (that means you). Other people are responsible for web development (all that good technical stuff). And, certain people take care of your site layout and other on-page goodies like SEO.</p>



<p>You get the picture. Everybody from a single developer to a single designer in a web design agency plays a vital role that (hopefully) results in a quality website.</p>



<p>Have you noticed your site failing to match your expectations? It’s a sign that whoever is on top doesn’t have a handle on your project. Also, poor communication is a sign that your account or project isn’t getting the bandwidth it deserves and you want to make sure you get all the tools your website provider could give you!</p>



<h3>4. “Changing of the Guard”</h3>



<p>If you’ve been with your web agency for a while, you’ll have been used to how it operates. You&#8217;re familiarity with the agency will have led to ties. And, the formed business relationships can contribute to your web design projects being done with ease and quality.</p>



<p>But, what if there’s a change in management? Granted, changes can be positive. Be that as it may, firms that undergo management shifts often experience transition periods.</p>



<p>Now, transition periods aren’t necessarily bad. Then again, can you really expect the same company to deliver the same results during this period?</p>



<p>As a site owner, you would be better off assuming that it won’t. Nor will your relationship be 100% consistent with what you’ve been accustomed to.</p>



<p>In short, while a change in management isn’t in itself good or bad, it may be a sign that you need to switch agencies.</p>



<h2>Addressing Your Concerns With Your Agency</h2>



<p>Even if things are heading South with your web agency, abruptly cutting ties is not a good idea. That said, before ending things with your web agency, it may be worth having a chat over your concerns.</p>



<p>Patching things up — whether it’s your relationship or your site — beats going through the hassle of an agency switch. If you’ve noticed any of the red flags in the earlier section, the talk would be an opportunity to bring them up.</p>



<p>If your web agency is sincere about upping its efforts, it will listen to your concerns. And, the agency will take your feedback seriously, using your input to improve all aspects of your site’s build.</p>



<p>For results, give your agency about 72 hours. Of course, you can agree on a time with your agency and check changes at the agreed-upon time.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if you see no effort made to improve your site as agreed, it may be time to begin the agency switching process.</p>



<p>Switching web design agencies is a process you need to handle with care. Parting ways on a sour note can lead to problems with your site and your access to it.</p>



<p>So, how do you safely make the switch? Here’s how!</p>



<h2>Prepping for Your Breakup With Your Web Design Agency</h2>



<p>So, now you’ve made up your mind to switch web design agencies. Here are the ways to change web design agencies without all the hassles and risks that come with abrupt switches.</p>



<p>We begin with a step you may have already considered — both with a new agency or in dating:</p>



<h3>1. Start Looking for Someone New</h3>



<p>Before switching agencies, you want to make sure you have options once the sunsetting process finishes. For this reason, you need to have a list of web design agencies you can go with once you’ve terminated your contract with your provider.</p>



<p>The challenge of seeking new agencies is the review process. By review, we mean establishing early if the agency will be a right fit for your goals and your site’s objectives.</p>



<p>There are two ways you can go about this. Both are equally effective. You can do any or all of the following when shopping around:</p>



<p>Ask for referrals: This is where your professional network comes in. Consult with your network and ask if they’ve had any experiences with other web design agencies. List agencies your network gives favorable accounts of, and consider accordingly.</p>



<p>Reference 3rd-Party Review Sites: Clutch and Design Rush are your best friends here. These are industry websites that provide online reviews that rate and rank web design firms on their success. The lists on these sites are an absolute goldmine of a database for web design agencies worth your time, attention, and marketing budget.</p>



<h3>2. Get Access to All Digital Properties</h3>



<p>Your digital properties are the items that grant you access to your site. Any web agency worth its salt needs to provide these to you with no hesitation. After all, it’s your site.</p>



<p>You need to get access to at least:</p>



<ul><li>Your site’s web hosting service</li><li>Domain registration</li><li>The CMS platform your site was built with (e.g., WordPress, Wix, Canva, Joomla, Drupal)</li><li>Plugins or extensions that require sign in details (e.g., Divi if the site was built using WordPress)</li><li>FTP</li><li>Social media links or associated accounts</li><li>Email addresses</li><li>Access to Google Adwords. Google Analytics, and Google Search Console</li><li>SEO tools or extensions like Yoast or SEMRush</li></ul>



<p>Gathering all of these will allow you to perform the next step:</p>



<h3>3. Make Backups</h3>



<p>Using your access to the front and back end of your site, you can begin making backups. You can do this yourself, of course. However, if you’ve already found a web design agency, you can allow them to create site backups.</p>



<h2>Having “The Talk”</h2>



<p>Preparing to switch agencies is a crucial step. But, it’s only step one.</p>



<p>Nobody likes getting ghosted. So, if you’re to handle the sunsetting process with class and care, you’ll have to have “the talk” with your web design agency.</p>



<p>Like breaking up with who used to be your better half, try to do this in person. Of course, if quarantine restrictions are still up as you’re reading this, you can do this on a video call.</p>



<p>You should bring up why you’re terminating their services and cap things off with a handshake and best wishes.</p>



<p>Once you’ve gotten the necessary pleasantries out of the way, you can now bring up the transition date.</p>



<h2>Setting Up the Transition Date</h2>



<p>This step is a must for the proper handover to be done. Setting a specific date when the change over should be happening will allow your old team to ramp down and the new team to ramp up.</p>



<p>It would also be best practice to get the old team to provide any written technical documentation they can. Things to focus on would be:</p>



<ul><li>Key dependencies of the current website</li><li>Instructions on how to manage any custom modules/code</li><li>Instructions on how to manage non-obvious content on the site</li><li>Content Management System or plugins used and whether or not these incur periodical costs</li></ul>



<p>A clear transition date will also allow both parties (you and your web design agency) to give their respective teams a heads up. This reduces any confusion that might occur in regard to workflow.</p>



<p>By the date of transition, no accessibility should remain with your old web design agency. All should be in your possession. And, of course, your new web design agency should have exclusive access.</p>



<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>



<p>Parting ways with your web design agency is very much like a break up in more ways than one — it’s never easy. It comes with a lot of uncertainty. And, feelings are bound to be hurt.</p>



<p>By managing the severing of ties, you’ll be making life easier for yourself and your web design agency. Do so with the utmost sense of decency and professionalism and you can prevent risks and losses to your website.</p>

<p>Websites are typically a considerable investment of time and money for most organizations. To make sure you&#8217;re making the most of both, you want to at least be average, right?</p>



<span id="more-29682"></span>



<p>Well then, that begs the question — what is the average lifespan of a website?</p>



<p>For the purpose of this article, when we say &#8216;average website lifespan,&#8217; we&#8217;re effectively referring to the average time a website remains mostly unchanged before undergoing a complete website redesign.</p>



<p>We decided to take a fresh look at the topic with more up-to-date information focused on small businesses that are the most successful. This article is the culmination of our research.</p>



<h2>What Is the Overall Average Website Lifespan?</h2>



<p>For our dataset, we choose to review the top 500 websites from this year&#8217;s <a href="https://www.inc.com/inc5000/2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">INC 5000</a>, along with several dozen of our client websites with the <a href="https://archive.org/web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wayback Machine</a>.</p>



<p>We examined the design and layout of each site over a specific period and calculated the time between significant website redesigns.</p>



<p>What did we discover?</p>



<p>The overall average lifespan of a website has been shortened to 2 years and 4 months (11% less than previously benchmarked by older studies).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1024" height="600" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Overall-Average-Image.jpg" alt="Overall Average Image" class="wp-image-30256" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Overall-Average-Image.jpg 1024w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Overall-Average-Image-300x176.jpg 300w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Overall-Average-Image-768x450.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Overall-Average-Image-24x14.jpg 24w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Overall-Average-Image-36x21.jpg 36w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Overall-Average-Image-48x28.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>What Is the Lifespan of Websites per Industry?</h2>



<p>As mentioned, our research involved observing the top 100 websites on the INC 5000 list and a few dozen of our own clients to determine the life expectancy of websites by industry. Here&#8217;s what we found:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="895" height="1024" src="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Industry-Bar-Chart-895x1024.jpg" alt="Industry Bar Chart" class="wp-image-30257" srcset="https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Industry-Bar-Chart-895x1024.jpg 895w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Industry-Bar-Chart-262x300.jpg 262w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Industry-Bar-Chart-768x878.jpg 768w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Industry-Bar-Chart-1343x1536.jpg 1343w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Industry-Bar-Chart-1791x2048.jpg 1791w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Industry-Bar-Chart-21x24.jpg 21w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Industry-Bar-Chart-31x36.jpg 31w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Industry-Bar-Chart-42x48.jpg 42w, https://huemor.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Industry-Bar-Chart.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 895px) 100vw, 895px" /></figure>



<ul><li><strong>Agencies:</strong> 1 year, 8 months</li><li><strong>Beauty:</strong> 1 year, 7 months</li><li><strong>Construction:</strong> 5 years, 5 months</li><li><strong>Consumer products &amp; services:</strong> 2 years, 8 months</li><li><strong>Corporate:</strong> 3 years, 6 months</li><li><strong>Education:</strong> 4 years, 6 months</li><li><strong>Energy:</strong> 3 years, 7 months</li><li><strong>Financial:</strong> 2 years, 2 months</li><li><strong>Food &amp; beverage:</strong> 1 year, 2 months</li><li><strong>Health:</strong> 2 years, 1 month</li><li><strong>Industrial &amp; manufacturing:</strong> 3 years, 3 months</li><li><strong>Media &amp; publishing:</strong> 2 years, 1 month</li><li><strong>Non-profit:</strong> 2 years, 3 months</li><li><strong>Real estate:</strong> 2 years</li><li><strong>Retail:</strong> 2 years, 4 months</li><li><strong>SaaS:</strong> 2 years, 2 months</li><li><strong>Technology/IT:</strong> 1 year, 9 months</li><li><strong>Travel &amp; Hospitality:</strong> 2 years, 6 months</li><li><strong>Sites by Huemor:</strong> 4 years, 6 months</li></ul>



<p>This data indicates that beauty brands, on average, appear to redesign their website most frequently, while construction companies redesign their websites least frequently.</p>



<p>We were also blown away to discover that websites built by us on average outperform the average lifespan by <span style="font-weight: bold;">more than 60%</span>.</p>

<h2>What Typically Prompts the Need for a Website Redesign?</h2>



<p>These are the primary factors that decide whether your website life cycle has completed its course and needs a redesign. Some of them have something to do with changes in your company, while others are concerned with developments in the web and industry.</p>



<h3>Competitors and Industry</h3>



<p>Over time, your competitors will innovate their websites with various improvements and communication to your company&#8217;s consumers. To stay competitive, you need to do the same.</p>



<p>If you haven&#8217;t looked at your competitors&#8217; websites yet, now is an excellent time to start. You should adapt as the industry evolves to avoid becoming obsolete. Your website will be compared to those of your competitors by prospective consumers. As a result, you need to make sure that your website meets their expectations.</p>



<p>Some expectations can include making your site more modern and your SEO ranking better than other competitor sites.</p>



<h3>Growing Business</h3>



<p>As a business grows often, so does its site. You can add to an existing website to an extent, but there&#8217;s an upper limit to that. If your company has expanded its service or product line dramatically or shifted focus, it may be time for a redesign.</p>



<p>In recent years, the number of firms that switched from B2B (business to business) to B2C (business to customer) has increased dramatically. This kind of transition demands significant changes not only to your website but also to your entire digital marketing strategy.</p>



<p>Your company&#8217;s website serves as its virtual front door. It introduces you to prospective consumers and expresses how you can assist them. It articulates to visitors that your company exists to help them rather than your competition.</p>



<h3>Technical Limitations</h3>



<p>Minor, incremental technological improvements can help any business or website remain relevant, such as replacing a logo with a higher-resolution image. However, over the past five years, developments such as the transition to mobile internet use have made complete website redesigns necessary for most companies. Businesses need to design their website to be mobile friendly since the current trend consumers are interested in is in a mobile format.</p>



<p>It could be that your company has new third-party software that needs to be seamlessly integrated, or it could be that the website simply doesn&#8217;t allow your staff to manage it correctly. Whatever the reason, technology has limited you, and you need a change. Users will leave websites that take too long to load or are poorly arranged.</p>



<h3>Poor Planning</h3>



<p>If the website redesign plan has initially been mismanaged, you might find yourself needing a change sooner rather than later.</p>



<p>The most common reason for a website redesign&#8217;s failure is a lack of planning. Regardless of the size of your business or industry, it&#8217;s essential that you address your website redesign strategically. Know what doesn&#8217;t work, what does, and what you want to accomplish.</p>

<h2>How To Extend the Lifespan of Your Website</h2>



<p>There are techniques for refreshing the appearance of your website by months or even years. Here are some tips for slowing down the aging process:</p>



<h3>Adding and Subtracting Information</h3>



<p>Visitors go to your website with the intent of completing a task or achieving a specific objective. Your website will need to be updated to accommodate changes in your company, rivals, industry, and user expectations as they arise.</p>



<p>Adding new information that is relevant or subtracting information that no longer promotes your company is one way to achieve this. You wouldn&#8217;t want visitors to discover content on your site that is no longer valid. Therefore it&#8217;s critical to keep your information up to date. Furthermore, maintaining your site will show Google that it is still active and will increase your visibility among users.</p>



<div class="huemorProtip-container" style="background-image:url(null);background-size:cover;background-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat"><h2 class="huemorProtip-title" style="color:black">Protip</h2><p style="color:black" class="huemorProtip-description">A great way of updating your current website is to clean up the design as well as the creative on the site. Through content management consumers will be able to find the content that matters to them as well as help to answer any questions they have about your company.</p><div class="huemorProtip-button"></div></div>



<h3>Redesign the Front Page</h3>



<p>Redesign the very first page that users view. You have to start somewhere after all! Your prospective customer should be able to visit your front page and instantly understand what you do and whether they are a good match for your brand.</p>



<p>Add new photos that update the webpage and delete unnecessary images, graphics, and the like. Removing clutter from the first page makes a positive first impression on new and returning users. However, this is only a temporary solution since significant changes might throw the front page out of sync with the rest of your site.</p>



<h3>Edit the Copy</h3>



<p>Edit current copy on the website to take out unnecessary words or information. Update copy to reflect the current state of your company.</p>



<p>If a visitor arrives at your site as a result of a search, you must persuade them that your service or product is the most ideal option for them at the moment. Make sure your web copy is up to date to show that what you offer is relevant to their current demands.</p>



<p>Actively monitoring and adjusting your website copy, as well as adding new content, will not only earn you the loyalty and confidence of your visitors but will also help you rank well in Google.</p>



<h3>Create New Assets</h3>



<p>New photography or video can go a long way. Re-shooting products, people, or producing a new company video could add new life to your existing website without requiring you to re-do the templates. Introducing new content, images, or videos can refresh a site&#8217;s look. It&#8217;s a sensible move since these elements can be reused in the future <a href="/blog/how-to-know-its-time-for-a-website-revamp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website revamp</a>.</p>



<h3>Conversion Optimization</h3>



<p>If you feel like everything is where it needs to be structurally, but sales or leads have slumped, consider conversion optimization services. These measured tests will focus on areas of the site with a strategic approach for improving conversion rates.</p>



<p>Conversion optimization helps increase the volume of highly qualified leads you acquire, boost revenue, cut acquisition expenses, get more value from your existing prospects and customers, and expand. Conversions can occur on your homepage, landing pages, blog, pricing page, and other areas of your website. Optimizing each area will help maximize the chances of turning visitors into paying customers.</p>

<h3>Update Your Website Navigation</h3>



<p>Adding key pages or removing clutter from your navigation can really transform the user journey for your website. Depending on your CMS, this can be relatively easy to do.</p>



<p>Simplify the navigation by deleting the links that get the fewest number of clicks. A well-organized and clear navigation system serves as a guide for visitors to your site&#8217;s numerous pages and content. It is essential to persuade visitors to stay, consume your content, and have a great user experience, resulting in increased revenue and brand loyalty for your company.</p>

<p>As a marketing manager, you’re in a position where you need to deliver results. As you take on one marketing campaign after another, you will likely have relied on one party to help your business — your marketing agency.</p>



<span id="more-29684"></span>



<p>For a while now, you may have had one on your payroll. Delivering the results you want, your marketing company may have amazed and impressed you and your team — at least, early on.</p>



<p>Lately, you’ve noticed a few red flags, like inconsistent results and some serious nickel-and-diming. You may be inclined to ignore these signs, giving the marketing company the benefit of the doubt. However, sometimes, it’s just time to rip off the band-aid and sever ties.</p>



<p>Nothing good lasts forever. If this is true, then something that’s going bad shouldn’t be allowed to go on at all. It’s said that client-agency relationships are ending faster than ever, at an <a href="https://start.askwonder.com/insights/average-new-business-pitch-cost-branding-advertising-agency-last-year-average-xle0orqh1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average of 3.2 years</a>. Notice any red flags, and it may be high time for an agency overhaul.</p>



<p>Reading this, you’re probably wondering if you should change marketing agencies. So, should you?</p>



<p>Here are seven signs that you should start sunsetting your services with your current marketing agency!</p>



<h2>When To Change Your Marketing Agency: The 7 Signs</h2>



<p>Telling your marketing company that you’ll be terminating your contract with them can feel awkward.</p>



<p>Indeed, sunsetting a service with an agency you’ve built rapport with can be an uncomfortable experience.</p>



<p>But, let’s face it. You hired for results.</p>



<p>Between hiring your agency and getting those results, things need to be in order. If your agency is disappointing your business in more ways than one, you’re better off with a different agency.</p>



<p>How do you tell if it’s time for a change?</p>



<h3>1. Poor Communication</h3>



<p>It may sound cliche, but communication is the foundation of any relationship — whether it’s a romantic or business relationship.</p>



<p>Nowhere is this truer than in your relationship with your marketing company. Usually, many of the problems you have with requirements and deadlines have communication as the limiting factor.</p>



<p>Sure, the occasional report getting lost in the mail or interweb need not be a deal-breaker.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, when instructions and content briefs start getting lost in translation regularly, you’ll have to rethink your choice.</p>



<p>Consider getting the frequent cold shoulder another red flag to change marketing agencies. You can count excruciatingly late responses that drag beyond the 48-hour window as warning signs as well.</p>



<p>The bottom line is this:</p>



<p>An agency worth its salt should be easy to get in touch with for any concern or subject matter. To achieve this, your agency must keep the lines of communication open.</p>



<p>Anything less is a sign to ditch your current marketing company.</p>



<h3>2. Difficulties With Collaboration</h3>



<p>Think of your marketing campaign as a carriage. You and your marketing company are the two horses pulling the carriage forward. If you and your agency are on the same foot and are clear about what needs to be done, guess what happens?</p>



<p>The carriage goes forward and farther.</p>



<p>Now, let’s envision a different scenario. Imagine what takes place when you think your marketing strategy should go in one direction (and it should go your way), and your agency thinks otherwise.</p>



<p>That’s right. Your marketing campaign either stays where it is or ends up in a ditch.</p>



<p>Collaboration begins with being clear on goals and responsibilities. You and your marketing company need to have clear ideas about what you want out of the marketing project. From here, both of you need to know who is responsible for what.</p>



<p>Then, and only then, can you expect results. However, if your marketing company doesn’t share your vision nor does what needs to be done, it may be time to leave the other horse in the stable.</p>



<h3>3. Unreliability</h3>



<p>When you hire an agency, you’re paying for several things. You’re paying your hard-earned money for the tools they’ll use, their staff, and their expertise. Other than those things mentioned, you’re also paying for their ability to deliver results consistently and on time.</p>



<p>Reliability is something you cannot put a price on. An agency that proves to you time and time again that it can deliver on time is worth keeping. The presence of reliability is crucial. It is established as soon as you sign a contract and make your first payment.</p>



<p>There are two indicators for unreliability. One is the inability to deliver results on time. Punctuality is something you can establish from the get-go. An agency that blows the first impression and turns in reports late is a clear red flag.</p>



<p>Another sign of unreliability is inconsistent results. Sure, nothing will be on par with your expectations 100% of the time. However, when there are dramatic dips in performance, you should be concerned.</p>



<p>If an agency does not keep up with your requirements and deadlines regularly, it’s a sign that you cannot trust it. In short, it is an unreliable agency — one you’re well within your rights to change.</p>



<h3>4. The Agency Remains Deaf to Your Input</h3>



<p>Indeed, when it comes to marketing, nobody is supposed to wear the hat of an expert other than your agency. However, there is a caveat to this.</p>



<p>In truth, nobody knows what you want better than you. Your marketing company should go into business with you understanding this. Brilliant as an agency’s ideas may be, it should work with you and not against you.</p>



<p>Turning a deaf ear to what you need to say not only brings about communication problems but also allows collaboration to take a hit. More importantly, allow your agency free reign of your campaign, and you might end up with marketing that tells their story — not yours.</p>



<h3>5. Lack of Transparency</h3>



<p>Are you dealing with an agency that uses more passwords than the Pentagon? Do you find yourself having to ask for login details to tools on a near-daily basis? If you’ve answered “yes” to both, then you’re dealing with an agency that’s not being transparent with you.</p>



<p>Transparency can put a huge dent in your trust. The marred trust can carry over negatively to how you communicate and collaborate. So, if you see any sign that your agency isn’t shooting straight with you, move on to a better one.</p>



<p>What should you look out for? Other than a password-protected way of doing things, watch out for:</p>



<ul><li>The agency refuses to fully explain their strategy</li><li>The agency does not divulge to you who’s working on the project from their side</li><li>Adds charges to an invoice without specifying the reason</li><li>Adding extra items to the invoice you need to pay without letting you know ahead of time or consulting with you</li></ul>



<h3>6. No Accountability</h3>



<p>Nobody wants to work with a person who’s an Olympic-level athlete in playing the blame game. A lack of accountability appears as a refusal to own up to mistakes or errors — albeit unintentional.</p>



<p>Granted, when a strategy fails, nobody is without fault. But, when the agency doesn’t acknowledge what it could have done better, you need to rethink your relationship.</p>



<p>A marketing company that lacks accountability will attribute the shortcomings of a marketing campaign to everybody but its employees and management. In most cases, they will point to your “lack of clarification” or your “delayed payment.”</p>



<h3>7. The Results Just Don’t Show</h3>



<p>Ultimately, why does any marketing manager hire a marketing agency? Management hires agencies for results.</p>



<p>If results just aren’t there within the agreed-upon time frame, the agency may not be up to the task. It’s that simple.</p>



<p>If this is the case, politely inform your agency that you’ll be going with a new agency that will bring results.</p>



<h2>When To Give Your Marketing Agency a Second Chance</h2>



<p>We’ve gone over when to change marketing agencies. But, is it possible to give yours a second chance? The answer is, “yes!”</p>



<p>Here are the few instances where you need to reconsider sunsetting your marketing agency:</p>



<h3>1. Extenuating Circumstances</h3>



<p>Through no fault of anybody, setbacks occur. A hiccup can be the product of force majeure or something like 2020.</p>



<p>Sometimes, you need to acknowledge that life gets in the way of your marketing aspirations. When it does, your agency is not to blame. Hence, you may want to keep your agency on board, especially if circumstances are not within anyone’s control.</p>



<h3>2. Isolated Incident</h3>



<p>Recurrent problems are clear signs of when to change marketing agencies. On the other hand, mishaps that are few and far between may be tolerable.</p>



<p>A positive track record with an agency should put any minor errors in perspective. Hence, you may want to think about severing ties over a single screw-up.</p>



<h3>3. The Problems Are Due to One Employee</h3>



<p>A marketing agency may be the sum of its parts. But, sometimes, you’ll be dealing with one specific employee from the team. When issues surface due to this employee, you can either cut ties with the company altogether or you can just bring it to the agency&#8217;s management.</p>



<p>The latter is a better alternative, especially if you’ve had a positive experience with the agency already. After all, hardly can one employee be a reflection of an agency’s performance.</p>



<h2>Know When To Change Marketing Agencies</h2>



<p>When you’re thinking of changing marketing agencies, all you need to do is keep an eye out for red flags. These red flags will indicate problems in your relationship and the agency’s performance.</p>



<p>Once you’ve confirmed the presence of problems in your relationship with your marketing agency, it’s time to end the relationship. Do this, and your marketing campaign will be in better hands with the next marketing agency you choose. Your perfectly optimized content goes here!</p>
